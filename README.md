# Claude Skills

A collection of custom skills that extend Claude's capabilities with specialized workflows, methods, and domain knowledge.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are modular packages that transform Claude from a general-purpose assistant into a specialized collaborator. Each skill contains:

- **SKILL.md** — Core instructions and workflows
- **references/** — Documentation Claude loads as needed
- **assets/** — Templates, examples, and resources for output

## Repository Structure

```text
claude-skills/
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── build.py              # Packages skills for Claude.ai
├── brainstorm/           # Each skill is a top-level folder

    └── brainstorm.skill
```

## Usage

### Option 1: Claude Code (CLI)

Claude Code reads skills directly from your filesystem. Reference them in your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

**If skills repo is inside your project:**

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Skills

When brainstorming, read and follow `./claude-skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md`.
```

**If skills repo is standalone (recommended):**

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Skills

When brainstorming, read and follow `/Users/robert/repos/claude-skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md`.
```

**Global access via ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md:**

Create `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to make skills available in all projects:

```markdown
# Global Claude Instructions

## Available Skills

- Brainstorming: Read `/Users/robert/repos/claude-skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md`
- [Other skills as you add them]
```

### Option 2: Claude.ai (Web/Mobile/Desktop)

The Claude.ai interface requires packaged `.skill` files.

**Build a single skill:**

```bash
python build.py brainstorm
```

**Build all skills:**

```bash
python build.py --all
```

**Output:** Packaged skills appear in `dist/` (e.g., `dist/brainstorm.skill`)

**To install:**

1. Open Claude.ai → Settings
2. Navigate to Skills (or Profile → Skills)
3. Upload the `.skill` file

## Creating New Skills

1. Create a new folder at the repo root:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-new-skill
   ```

2. Create the required `SKILL.md`:

   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my-new-skill
   description: What this skill does and when to use it. Be specific about triggers.
   ---

   # My New Skill

   [Instructions for Claude]
   ```

3. Add optional resources:
   - `references/` — Documentation to load as needed
   - `assets/` — Templates, examples, files for output

4. Package for Claude.ai:

   ```bash
   python build.py my-new-skill
   ```

## Skill Design Principles

1. **Concise is key** — Only include what Claude doesn't already know
2. **Progressive disclosure** — Core instructions in SKILL.md, details in references/
3. **Clear triggers** — The `description` field determines when the skill activates

## Available Skills

| Skill        | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `brainstorm` | Collaborative multi-session brainstorming with versioned documents, 25+ thinking methods, and decision tracking |

## Featured Skill: Brainstorm

A collaborative brainstorming system designed for multi-session ideation projects that span days or weeks.

### Philosophy

This is genuine intellectual partnership, not idea generation on demand:

- Claude brings observations and suggestions proactively
- Pushes back directly on weak reasoning or blind spots
- Surfaces connections to other projects (in connected mode)
- Asks hard questions the user might avoid
- Logs reasoning and disagreements for future reference

### Session Flow

**Session Start** — Claude asks:

1. New or continuing project?
2. Deep exploration or quick progress today?
3. Connected mode (cross-project awareness) or clean-slate mode (fresh thinking)?
4. Confirms the brainstorming context and recommends appropriate methods

**During Session:**

- Proactively offers observations: "I notice you keep circling back to X—want to dig into why?"
- Challenges weak reasoning: "I'm not convinced by that reasoning. Here's why..."
- Marks decision points: "This feels like a decision point. Should we log: [decision]?"
- Suggests methods when stuck or needs structure
- Captures parking lot ideas for other projects

**Session End:**

- Exit summary with current state, decisions made, open questions
- The overnight test: "What question should you sit with before our next session?"
- Generates versioned project document

### Brainstorming Methods (25+)

**Divergent (Generate Ideas):**
SCAMPER, Random Stimulus, Forced Analogies, Mind Mapping, Worst Possible Idea, TRIZ Principles

**Convergent (Focus & Decide):**
Affinity Grouping, Dot Voting, Weighted Scoring, Elimination Rounds, 2x2 Matrix

**Problem-Framing:**
First Principles, 5 Whys, Inversion, Problem Reframing, Jobs-to-be-Done

**Perspective Shifts:**
Six Thinking Hats, Steelman, Audience Reality Check, Stakeholder Mapping, Time Horizons

**Evaluation & Risk:**
Pre-mortem, Assumption Surfacing, 10/10/10, Reversibility Test

**Theological/Philosophical:**
Presuppositional Analysis, Telos Examination, Stewardship Frame

### Idea Maturity Tracking

Each idea is tracked through maturity levels:

| Level      | Meaning                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Raw        | Just captured, unexamined            |
| Developing | Being explored, has potential        |
| Refined    | Shaped, tested, ready for evaluation |
| Ready      | Decision made, ready to execute      |
| Parked     | Not now, but worth keeping           |
| Eliminated | Killed, with documented reasoning    |

### File Structure Created

```text
brainstorms/
├── _parking-lot.md              # Cross-project idea capture
└── project-name/
    ├── _index.md                # Changelog and decision log
    ├── project-name-v1.md       # Version 1
    ├── project-name-v2.md       # Version 2
    └── ...
```

### Use Cases

- SaaS products and software tools
- Book ideas and content strategy
- Newsletter and creative projects
- Business decisions and strategic planning
- Any creative or analytical challenge requiring sustained thinking

## Version Control Notes

- **Commit the source folders**, not the `.skill` files
- The `dist/` folder is gitignored by default
- Rebuild `.skill` files anytime with `build.py`

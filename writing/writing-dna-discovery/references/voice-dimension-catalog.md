# Voice Dimension Catalog

A comprehensive framework for analyzing and documenting a writer's voice. Each dimension includes what to look for in samples, questions to surface it, and examples of strong vs. weak capture.

---

## Framework Overview

Voice dimensions are organized into levels:

1. **Sentence Level** — How they construct individual sentences
2. **Paragraph & Structure Level** — How they build and organize
3. **Word Level** — Their vocabulary and word choices
4. **Voice & Tone Level** — Their attitude and emotional register
5. **Relationship Level** — How they connect with readers
6. **Signature Level** — Their unique fingerprints
7. **Anti-Pattern Level** — What they never do
8. **Register-Specific** — Mode-dependent patterns

Not all dimensions apply equally to all writers. Focus on what's most distinctive.

---

## 1. Sentence Level

### 1.1 Rhythm & Architecture

**What It Captures:**
The music of their prose—how sentences flow, where emphasis lands, the relationship between sentence lengths.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Average sentence length and variation
- Short/long alternation patterns
- Internal clause structure (simple vs. compound vs. complex)
- Where the punch lands (front-loaded vs. end-emphasis)
- "Breath units"—where you'd naturally pause reading aloud

**Sample Analysis Questions:**

- What's the dominant sentence length?
- Do they alternate predictably or unpredictably?
- Are sentences mostly simple, or do they nest clauses?
- Do they save impact for the end of sentences (per Strunk's Rule 18)?

**Interview Questions:**

- "When you read your sentences aloud, what rhythm do you hear?"
- "Do you tend toward short punchy sentences or longer flowing ones?"
- "Do you consciously vary your sentence length, or does it happen naturally?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Favors medium-length sentences (12-20 words) punctuated by occasional single-clause punches (4-7 words) for emphasis. End-weighted structure—saves the key word for the final position. Rarely uses compound sentences with 'and'; prefers sequences of shorter sentences."

**Weak Capture Example:**
> "Uses varied sentence lengths." (Too vague—applies to everyone)

---

### 1.2 Punctuation Personality

**What It Captures:**
Their relationship with punctuation—which marks they favor, avoid, and how they deploy them.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Em-dash frequency and usage (parenthetical, dramatic pause, substitutes for colons)
- Semicolon presence (formal/academic marker)
- Colon usage (explanatory, dramatic)
- Parenthetical asides (frequent, rare, never)
- Comma density (heavy or light)
- Exclamation points (enthusiastic, ironic, absent)
- Ellipses (trailing thoughts, dramatic pauses)
- Question marks in non-questions (rhetorical device)

**Sample Analysis Questions:**

- Count punctuation marks per 1000 words
- How are em-dashes used? (Pairs for parentheticals? Single for emphasis?)
- Are semicolons present? In what contexts?
- What's the comma-to-sentence ratio?

**Interview Questions:**

- "What's your relationship with em-dashes?"
- "Do you use semicolons? When?"
- "How do you feel about exclamation points?"
- "Do you use parenthetical asides?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Heavy em-dash user—deploys them for parenthetical insertions (pairs) and dramatic pivots (singles). Never uses semicolons. Light comma usage; prefers shorter sentences to heavy comma-separated clauses. Exclamation points only in dialogue, never in prose."

**Weak Capture Example:**
> "Uses standard punctuation." (Meaningless)

---

### 1.3 Opening Word Tendencies

**What It Captures:**
How they begin sentences—a subtle but distinctive fingerprint.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- "I" sentence frequency
- Sentences starting with "And" or "But"
- Dependent clause openers ("When...", "If...", "Although...")
- Subject-first vs. varied openings
- "The" and "This" starters
- Transitional word starters ("However," "Moreover," "Nevertheless")

**Sample Analysis Questions:**

- What percentage of sentences start with "I"?
- Do they use sentence-initial "And" or "But"?
- How often do sentences open with dependent clauses?
- Are there forbidden openings (words they never start with)?

**Interview Questions:**

- "Do you start sentences with 'And' or 'But'?"
- "How do you feel about starting with 'I' too often?"
- "Do you consciously vary your sentence openings?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Rarely starts with 'I' (less than 5% of sentences). Frequently uses 'And' to begin sentences for rhythm. Avoids formal transitions ('However,' 'Moreover')—prefers 'But' for contrast. Often opens with concrete nouns or action verbs."

---

## 2. Paragraph & Structure Level

### 2.1 Paragraph Construction

**What It Captures:**
How they build paragraphs—length, internal logic, topic sentence placement.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Average paragraph length (sentences and words)
- Topic sentence placement (first, last, implied)
- Single-sentence paragraphs (frequency, purpose)
- Internal logic flow
- How paragraphs end (conclusion, transition, cliffhanger)

**Interview Questions:**

- "Do you lead with your main point or build to it?"
- "Do you use single-sentence paragraphs? For what effect?"
- "How long do your paragraphs tend to run?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences typical). Topic sentence usually first, but occasionally saves the point for a punchline ending. Uses single-sentence paragraphs liberally for emphasis—often follows a longer paragraph with a one-liner that lands the point."

---

### 2.2 Transitional Patterns

**What It Captures:**
How they move between ideas and sections.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Explicit transitions ("However," "Furthermore," "In contrast")
- Implicit transitions (idea flow without marker words)
- Bridge words/repeated concepts
- White space usage
- Section break philosophy

**Interview Questions:**

- "How do you typically transition between ideas?"
- "Do you use words like 'however' and 'moreover,' or do you avoid them?"
- "How do you signal to readers that you're shifting topics?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Avoids formal transitions entirely—no 'However,' 'Moreover,' 'Furthermore.' Creates flow through repeated concepts and question-answer patterns. Uses paragraph breaks liberally rather than transitional phrases. Occasionally deploys 'But' for sharp contrast."

---

### 2.3 Opening Moves

**What It Captures:**
How they begin pieces—the hook, the first impression.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- In media res (drops reader into action/scene)
- Provocative statement (bold claim to grab attention)
- Question hook (engages reader curiosity)
- Context-setting (establishes time/place/situation)
- Anecdote lead (story that introduces theme)
- Thesis-first (states the point immediately)

**Interview Questions:**

- "How do you typically start a piece?"
- "Do you prefer to hook readers or orient them first?"
- "What makes a good opening for you?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Opens with concrete action or image—never with context-setting or throat-clearing. First sentence is always short (under 10 words). Avoids questions as openers. Anecdotes are rare; prefers observation or assertion."

---

### 2.4 Closing Moves

**What It Captures:**
How they end pieces—the last impression.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Callback to opening (circular structure)
- Open question (leaves reader thinking)
- Definitive statement (lands the point)
- Quiet landing (trails off gently)
- Call to action (directs reader behavior)
- Image or scene (ends with concrete detail)

**Interview Questions:**

- "How do you like to end a piece?"
- "Do you prefer endings that land hard or trail off?"
- "Do you ever call back to your opening?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Ends with concrete image or action, not abstraction. Never summarizes or restates the point. Occasional callbacks to opening for structural satisfaction. Avoids calls to action except in explicitly promotional content."

---

## 3. Word Level

### 3.1 Vocabulary Character

**What It Captures:**
The flavor of their word choices—simple or complex, concrete or abstract, narrow or wide.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Anglo-Saxon vs. Latinate balance ("help" vs. "assistance," "start" vs. "commence")
- Average word length
- Vocabulary breadth (narrow/precise vs. wide/varied)
- Concrete vs. abstract tendency
- Specificity level (generic terms vs. precise names)

**Interview Questions:**

- "Do you prefer short words or longer, more precise ones?"
- "Do you repeat key words or vary them with synonyms?"
- "How technical or specialized does your vocabulary get?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Strongly Anglo-Saxon—prefers 'start' to 'commence,' 'help' to 'facilitate,' 'end' to 'terminate.' Concrete and specific: names things precisely rather than using generic terms. Vocabulary is narrow but intentional—repeats key words rather than synonym-swapping."

---

### 3.2 Favorite Words & Phrases

**What It Captures:**
Their verbal fingerprints—words and phrases they return to.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Recurring words (count frequencies)
- Pet phrases or constructions
- Signature transitions
- Characteristic intensifiers

**Interview Questions:**

- "Are there words you find yourself using often?"
- "Do you have pet phrases you return to?"
- "Are there words that just feel like 'you'?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Returns to: 'actually,' 'genuinely,' 'the thing is.' Uses 'look' as a paragraph opener when being direct. Favors 'but' over 'however,' 'so' over 'therefore.' Characteristic construction: 'The point isn't X, it's Y.'"

---

### 3.3 Avoided Words

**What It Captures:**
Words they consciously or unconsciously avoid—often more distinctive than favorites.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Words notably absent
- Formal terms they never use
- Clichés they avoid
- Industry jargon they reject

**Interview Questions:**

- "Are there words you consciously avoid? Why?"
- "What words make you cringe when you see them?"
- "Are there clichés you refuse to use?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Never uses: 'utilize' (always 'use'), 'leverage' (too corporate), 'impactful' (fake word), 'learnings' (plural that shouldn't exist). Avoids: 'very' (too vague), 'really' (unless in dialogue), 'just' (weakens statements)."

---

### 3.4 Contraction Philosophy

**What It Captures:**
Their use of contractions—a major tone indicator.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Contraction frequency
- Which contractions they use (don't, won't, can't, I'm, you're, etc.)
- Context-dependent variation
- Inconsistencies

**Interview Questions:**

- "Do you use contractions? Always, sometimes, never?"
- "Does it depend on the context?"
- "Are there specific contractions you avoid?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Heavy contraction user—'don't,' 'won't,' 'isn't,' 'I'm,' 'you're' throughout. Never uses 'cannot' (always 'can't'). Exception: avoids contractions in formal argument moments for emphasis ('This is not acceptable' vs. 'This isn't acceptable')."

---

## 4. Voice & Tone Level

### 4.1 Emotional Temperature

**What It Captures:**
The warmth or coolness of their prose—their baseline emotional register.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Warm markers: personal anecdotes, "I/you" language, emotional words
- Cool markers: impersonal constructions, analytical distance, neutral vocabulary
- Where do they show enthusiasm or passion?
- Where do they remain detached?

**Interview Questions:**

- "Would you describe your writing as warm or cool?"
- "How much of yourself shows up in your writing?"
- "When do you let emotion in, and when do you stay analytical?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Warm but measured. Personal anecdotes appear once or twice per piece. Uses 'I' comfortably but not excessively. Shows enthusiasm through specific detail rather than exclamation. Avoids sentimentality; prefers understated emotion."

---

### 4.2 Confidence Style

**What It Captures:**
How they assert vs. hedge—their relationship with uncertainty.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Direct assertion vs. hedged claims
- Hedge words: "perhaps," "might," "seems," "arguably," "somewhat"
- Qualifiers: "I think," "in my view," "it appears"
- Certainty markers: "clearly," "obviously," "certainly"

**Interview Questions:**

- "Do you hedge your claims or state them directly?"
- "How do you handle uncertainty in writing?"
- "Do you say 'I think' before opinions, or just state them?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "States opinions directly without 'I think' qualifiers. Hedges only on genuinely uncertain claims. Never uses 'arguably' or 'somewhat.' Uses 'might' sparingly and specifically. Certainty comes through assertion, not through words like 'clearly' or 'obviously.'"

---

### 4.3 Formality Level

**What It Captures:**
Where they sit on the formal-casual spectrum.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Vocabulary register
- Sentence construction complexity
- Contraction usage
- Direct address
- Colloquialisms and slang

**Interview Questions:**

- "Do you think of yourself as a formal or casual writer?"
- "Does your formality level change based on context?"
- "Are you comfortable with slang or colloquialisms?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Conversational but not sloppy. Uses contractions freely, addresses reader directly, but avoids slang. Sentences are clear and accessible, never academic. Would never write 'heretofore' but also wouldn't write 'gonna.'"

---

### 4.4 Humor Approach

**What It Captures:**
If and how they use humor.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Humor presence or absence
- Types: dry wit, self-deprecation, sarcasm, wordplay, absurdist
- Placement: woven throughout, strategic moments, asides
- Tone: gentle, sharp, dark

**Interview Questions:**

- "Do you use humor in your writing?"
- "What kind of humor, if so?"
- "When does humor appear—throughout, or at specific moments?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Dry wit appears in parenthetical asides, never as the main focus. Self-deprecating when sharing personal failures. Avoids puns and wordplay. Humor is always in service of a point, never just for laughs. Sarcasm is rare and subtle."

---

### 4.5 Authority Stance

**What It Captures:**
How they position themselves relative to the reader.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Expert: teaching from above, authoritative claims
- Guide: leading alongside, experienced mentor
- Fellow traveler: figuring it out together, learning in public
- Curious explorer: asking questions, discovering

**Interview Questions:**

- "How do you position yourself relative to your reader?"
- "Do you write as an expert, a guide, or something else?"
- "How much do you admit uncertainty or learning?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Guide stance—more experienced than the reader but not lecturing from above. Shares personal mistakes freely. Uses 'we' to include reader in shared challenges. Authoritative on specific claims but humble about broader questions."

---

## 5. Relationship Level

### 5.1 First Person Presence

**What It Captures:**
How much "I" shows up and in what contexts.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- "I" frequency per 1000 words
- Contexts: opinions, experiences, actions, thoughts
- "My" usage for possessives
- Impersonal alternatives they might use

**Interview Questions:**

- "How much do you use 'I' in your writing?"
- "When does 'I' appear—sharing opinions, experiences, both?"
- "Do you ever avoid 'I' intentionally?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Moderate 'I' usage—present but not dominant. Uses 'I' for experiences and specific opinions, not for obvious observations ('I think the sky is blue'). Occasionally writes 'we' to include reader. Never uses impersonal constructions ('one might argue') as 'I' substitute."

---

### 5.2 Second Person Usage

**What It Captures:**
Their direct address of the reader.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- "You" frequency and contexts
- Imperative commands ("Consider...", "Notice...")
- Questions directed at reader
- Inclusive "you" vs. specific "you"

**Interview Questions:**

- "Do you address the reader directly with 'you'?"
- "How do you feel about giving readers direct commands?"
- "Do you ask your readers questions?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Direct 'you' address throughout—conversational relationship with reader. Occasional imperatives ('Consider...', 'Notice...') but not bossy. Asks rhetorical questions to engage reader thinking. Never uses 'one' as formal 'you' substitute."

---

### 5.3 Reader Assumptions

**What It Captures:**
What they assume readers know—the implicit contract.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Unexplained terms or concepts
- Level of explanation
- References (explained or assumed)
- Sophistication of vocabulary

**Interview Questions:**

- "How much do you assume your reader knows?"
- "Do you define terms or use them casually?"
- "Do you write for beginners, experts, or somewhere between?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Assumes reader is intelligent but not expert. Explains industry jargon on first use but doesn't over-explain common concepts. References (books, ideas, people) are often unexplained—trusts reader to look them up if curious. Doesn't talk down."

---

## 6. Signature Level

### 6.1 Distinctive Moves

**What It Captures:**
Things they do that are recognizably theirs—their fingerprints.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Unusual constructions
- Characteristic flourishes
- Structural signatures
- Things that would make someone say "that sounds like them"

**Interview Questions:**

- "What do people recognize about your writing?"
- "Are there moves you make that feel distinctly 'you'?"
- "What would a parody of your writing exaggerate?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Ends paragraphs with concrete images, not abstractions. Uses em-dashes as rhythm tool, not parenthetical. Opens sections with single-word sentences. Makes lists in running prose rather than bullet points. Tendency to build arguments through negation: 'It's not X. It's not Y. It's Z.'"

---

### 6.2 Pet Phrases

**What It Captures:**
Phrases they return to repeatedly—verbal habits.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Recurring phrases across pieces
- Go-to transitions
- Characteristic framing
- Habitual constructions

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "'The thing is...' (to introduce key point), 'Here's what I mean' (to introduce example), 'Look' (paragraph opener for directness), 'Not to mention...' (to add secondary point), 'But here's the problem' (to introduce complication)."

---

### 6.3 Characteristic Tics

**What It Captures:**
Unconscious patterns—things they might not realize they do.

**What to Look for in Samples:**

- Sentence-start habits
- Filler words
- Rhythm patterns
- Punctuation quirks

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Starts many sentences with 'And' or 'But' without realizing frequency. Tends toward three-beat rhythms in lists. Uses comma before 'too' at end of sentences. Puts 'actually' mid-sentence rather than at start."

---

## 7. Anti-Pattern Level

### 7.1 What They Never Do

**What It Captures:**
Patterns, structures, words they avoid—as distinctive as what they do.

**What to Look for:**

- Absent patterns (things never appearing in samples)
- User-stated avoidances
- Violations that would feel "wrong"

**Interview Questions:**

- "What would you never write?"
- "What makes you cringe in writing?"
- "Are there rules you consciously break?"

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Never uses passive voice except for specific emphasis. Never starts with 'In conclusion' or 'In summary.' Avoids semicolons entirely. Never uses 'utilize' (always 'use'). Won't write numbered lists in running prose. Never addresses reader as 'dear reader.'"

---

### 7.2 What Would Feel "Off"

**What It Captures:**
Patterns that would break the spell—make readers think "that doesn't sound like them."

**Strong Capture Example:**
> "Excessive formality would feel off—'heretofore,' 'subsequently,' 'pursuant to.' Sentimental language would jar—'touched my heart,' 'brought tears to my eyes.' Corporate jargon would be wrong—'leverage,' 'synergize,' 'circle back.' Heavy hedging would feel unlike them—'arguably,' 'it might be suggested.'"

---

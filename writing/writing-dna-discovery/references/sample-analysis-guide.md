# Sample Analysis Guide

How to systematically analyze writing samples to extract voice DNA patterns.

---

## The Analysis Philosophy

Sample analysis is the foundation, but not the whole building:

1. **Samples reveal patterns** — They show what the writer does, not always why.
2. **Interview confirms patterns** — Samples might be atypical; interview validates.
3. **Patterns need examples** — Always capture quotes that demonstrate patterns.
4. **Gaps must be noted** — What can't we learn from this sample?

Never finalize a pattern based on samples alone without interview confirmation.

## Before You Begin

### Gather Context

Before analyzing, know:

- **What register is this?** (blog, fiction, technical, essay, email)
- **Is this typical?** (or was it written for an unusual context)
- **Was it edited?** (by the writer alone, or by others)
- **How old is it?** (recent, or potentially outdated)
- **How long is it?** (longer samples = more reliable patterns)

### Ideal Sample Characteristics

**More reliable:**
- Recent (last 1-2 years)
- Self-edited (not heavily touched by others)
- Typical of what they normally write
- At least 1000+ words
- Multiple samples (2-3 minimum)

**Less reliable:**
- Old (style may have evolved)
- Heavily edited by others
- Written for unusual circumstances
- Very short (under 500 words)
- Single sample only

## The Three-Pass Approach

### First Pass: Gut Check (2-3 minutes)

Read the sample quickly. Note immediate impressions.

**Ask yourself:**
- What 3 things jump out about this writing?
- What's the overall temperature? (warm, cool, neutral)
- What register/mode is this?
- Does anything feel distinctive or unusual?

**Capture gut impressions before they fade.** First reactions often identify the most distinctive patterns.

**Example gut notes:**
> "Short sentences. Very direct. Almost aggressive. Lots of 'But' at sentence starts. No hedging at all."

---

### Second Pass: Quantitative Scan (5-10 minutes)

Measure objective patterns.

#### Sentence Metrics

| Metric | How to Measure |
|--------|----------------|
| Average sentence length | Word count / sentence count |
| Length range | Shortest to longest sentence |
| Length distribution | How often short (<10), medium (10-20), long (20+) |

#### Punctuation Count

| Mark | Count per 1000 words |
|------|---------------------|
| Em-dashes | |
| Semicolons | |
| Colons | |
| Parentheses (pairs) | |
| Exclamation points | |
| Question marks | |

#### Word Patterns

| Pattern | Count/Observe |
|---------|--------------|
| "I" sentences | How many start with "I"? |
| "And"/"But" openers | How many sentences start with these? |
| Contractions | Present? Frequent? |
| Paragraph lengths | Short (1-2 sentences), medium (3-5), long (6+) |

#### Quick Vocabulary Check

- Any recurring words?
- Latinate or Anglo-Saxon preference?
- Technical terms present?
- Jargon or colloquialisms?

---

### Third Pass: Qualitative Analysis (10-15 minutes)

This is where you find the distinctive patterns.

#### Sentence Architecture

- **Internal structure:** Simple, compound, or complex sentences?
- **Clause patterns:** Where do they nest clauses?
- **Emphasis placement:** Front-loaded or end-weighted?
- **Fragments:** Present? Intentional?

**Look for:**
- Unusual constructions
- Signature rhythms
- Consistent patterns across the sample

#### Paragraph Patterns

- **Construction:** How do they build paragraphs?
- **Topic sentences:** First, last, implied?
- **Length variation:** All similar, or strategic variety?
- **Endings:** How do paragraphs conclude?

#### Transitions

- **Explicit markers:** "However," "Furthermore," etc.
- **Implicit flow:** Ideas connect without markers
- **Bridge words:** Repeated concepts that link ideas
- **White space:** Strategic breaks

#### Opening & Closing

- **How does the piece begin?** (hook, scene, question, statement)
- **How does it end?** (callback, question, definitive, trailing)
- **Are these moves typical?** (compare across samples if possible)

#### Tone Markers

- **Warmth indicators:** Personal anecdotes, "I/you" language, emotional words
- **Coolness indicators:** Impersonal constructions, analytical distance
- **Confidence level:** Hedging vs. assertion
- **Authority stance:** Expert, guide, fellow traveler

#### Signature Elements

- **What's unusual?** Things you don't see in most writing
- **What's consistent?** Patterns that repeat
- **What's recognizable?** Things that would identify this writer

## Comparative Analysis

When you have multiple samples:

### Consistency Check

| Pattern | Sample 1 | Sample 2 | Sample 3 | Consistent? |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Sentence length | | | | |
| Punctuation style | | | | |
| Paragraph length | | | | |
| Tone | | | | |
| First person presence | | | | |

**Consistent patterns** = High confidence, can include in profile without caveat

**Inconsistent patterns** = Need investigation:
- Different registers?
- Evolution over time?
- Context-dependent variation?
- One sample is atypical?

### Variation Analysis

When patterns differ across samples:

1. **Identify the variation:** What's different?
2. **Seek explanation:** Is there a reason?
3. **Determine whether to:**
   - Capture dominant pattern (most frequent)
   - Capture context-dependent pattern (when X, do Y)
   - Treat as different registers (separate DNA docs)
   - Investigate further in interview

## What to Look For (Quick Reference)

### Highly Distinctive Patterns

These are often the most identifying:

- Unusual punctuation habits
- Sentence opening patterns
- Paragraph ending moves
- Distinctive transitions
- Pet phrases or constructions
- Unusual word choices
- Signature rhythms

### Common But Important Patterns

These establish the baseline:

- Sentence length tendencies
- Formality level
- First person presence
- Contraction usage
- Paragraph length
- Tone/temperature

### Often Overlooked Patterns

Don't forget to check:

- What's absent (things they never do)
- Opening moves across multiple pieces
- How they handle uncertainty
- Question usage patterns
- Humor placement and style

---

## Gap Identification

After analysis, note what you CAN'T determine from samples:

### Common Gaps

- **Intent:** Why do they make certain choices?
- **Aspirational vs. actual:** Is this how they want to write or how they do?
- **Context-dependence:** Does this change in other situations?
- **Evolution:** Is this current or outdated?
- **Editing impact:** How much was changed by others?
- **Anti-patterns:** What do they avoid? (Absence is hard to prove)
- **Humor:** If not present in samples, does that mean none exists?

### Interview to Fill Gaps

For each gap, identify the interview question that would fill it:

| Gap | Question to Ask |
|-----|-----------------|
| Why short sentences? | "Do you consciously write short sentences? Why?" |
| Is this formality typical? | "Is this your usual level of formality?" |
| Why no contractions? | "Do you avoid contractions intentionally?" |
| Edited by others? | "Was this piece edited by someone else?" |

---

## Red Flags

Signs the sample may not be representative:

### Content Red Flags

- **Heavy jargon** in supposedly casual writing
- **Sudden formality shifts** mid-piece
- **Inconsistent voice** within the same piece
- **Generic AI-like patterns** (might not be their writing)

### Context Red Flags

- Sample is very old (5+ years)
- Sample was for unusual context (school, job application)
- Sample was heavily edited by others
- Sample is much shorter than typical work
- Only one sample available

### Pattern Red Flags

- Patterns that contradict user's self-description
- Patterns wildly different from other samples
- Patterns that match AI writing tells

**When red flags appear:** Note them. Ask clarifying questions in interview. Don't assume sample represents true voice.

## From Analysis to DNA Document

### Translating Findings

| Analysis Finding | DNA Document Entry |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "Avg sentence length 12 words, range 4-28" | "Short sentences (avg 12 words) with occasional longer ones for rhythm" |
| "Em-dash count: 8 per 1000 words" | "Heavy em-dash user—deployed for parenthetical insertions and dramatic pivots" |
| "All paragraphs 2-4 sentences" | "Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences); uses single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis" |
| "No semicolons found" | "Never uses semicolons" (confirm in interview) |
| "'Actually' appears 6 times" | "Pet word: 'actually'—appears frequently for emphasis" |

### Confidence Levels

Rate each pattern:

- **High confidence:** Consistent across samples, confirmed in interview
- **Medium confidence:** Consistent in samples, not yet confirmed
- **Low confidence:** Based on single sample or inconsistent across samples

## Common Analysis Mistakes

1. **Overgeneralizing from one sample** — Wait for confirmation before finalizing patterns.

2. **Missing the forest for trees** — Don't get lost in metrics. What makes this writer recognizable?

3. **Ignoring gut reactions** — First impressions often catch the most distinctive patterns.

4. **Treating absence as avoidance** — Just because something's not in the sample doesn't mean they never do it.

5. **Assuming samples are representative** — They might be unusual. Always check.

6. **Skipping gap identification** — Know what you don't know.

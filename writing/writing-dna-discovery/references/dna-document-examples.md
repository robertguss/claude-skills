# DNA Document Examples

Annotated examples showing what good Voice DNA Documents look like at different development levels.

---

## What Makes a Good DNA Document

Before the examples, here's what to aim for:

### Specificity Over Generality

**Bad:** "Uses conversational tone"
**Good:** "Direct address of reader ('you') at least once per paragraph. Never uses 'one' as formal substitute. Questions directed at reader for engagement, not rhetoric."

### Examples Over Descriptions

**Bad:** "Favors short sentences"
**Good:** "Short sentences (8-15 words typical), often ending paragraphs with punchy 4-7 word statements. Example: 'That changes everything.' 'Here's the thing.' 'It doesn't work.'"

### Anti-Patterns Are Essential

A profile without anti-patterns is only half complete. What they DON'T do is as distinctive as what they do.

### Ghost Writer Briefing Is Actionable

The briefing should be specific enough that the ghost writer can follow it without having read the full profile.

## Example 1: Minimum Viable Profile (Blog Writer)

*This represents the minimum acceptable profile for basic ghost writing. Good enough to produce recognizable output, but would benefit from deeper development.*

### Voice DNA: Alex Chen
**Mode:** Blog / Newsletter
**Version:** 1 | Created: 2024-01-15 | Last Updated: 2024-01-15

---

#### Quick Reference

**Core Temperature:** Warm but direct—friendly authority

**Sentence Signature:** Short punchy sentences. Rarely more than 15 words. Paragraphs often end with 4-7 word statements.

**Distinctive Moves:**
- Opens sections with one-word or two-word sentences
- Uses "Look," to begin paragraphs when getting serious
- Ends paragraphs with concrete statements, not abstractions

**Never Does:**
- Long sentences with multiple clauses
- Formal transitions ("Moreover," "Furthermore")
- Hedging phrases ("It might be argued that...")

---

#### Voice Profile

**Sentence Level**
*Status: Developed*

Short and direct. Average sentence length is 10-12 words. Rarely exceeds 20 words. Often uses sentence fragments for emphasis ("Wrong." "Exactly." "Here's why.").

Patterns:
- Punchy closers at paragraph ends
- One-word sentences for emphasis
- Avoids compound sentences with multiple "and" conjunctions

**Punctuation Personality**
*Status: Emerging*

Uses em-dashes sparingly—for single dramatic pivots, not pairs. No semicolons. Light on commas.

**Word Choice & Vocabulary**
*Status: Developed*

Anglo-Saxon preference: "start" not "commence," "help" not "facilitate," "end" not "terminate."

Favorite words: "actually," "look," "here's the thing"
Avoided words: "utilize," "leverage," "impactful," "learnings"

Contractions: Always. Never "do not" when "don't" works.

**Tone & Attitude**
*Status: Developed*

Confident and direct. States opinions without "I think" qualifiers. Doesn't hedge. Warmth comes through in direct address and occasional self-deprecation, not through emotional language.

**Reader Relationship**
*Status: Emerging*

Heavy "you" usage. Speaks directly to reader. Assumes reader is smart but not expert. Never talks down.

---

#### Anti-Patterns

| Pattern to Avoid | Why It's Wrong for Them |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Long complex sentences | They never write past 20 words |
| "However," "Moreover" | Too formal—always uses "But" |
| Hedging ("perhaps," "arguably") | They assert directly |
| Passive voice | Active voice only |

**AI Patterns to Suppress:**
- [x] "It's important to note"
- [x] "In conclusion"
- [x] Significance puffery
- [x] "Delve into"
- [x] Rule of three constructions

---

#### Ghost Writer Briefing

**Voice Essence:**
Direct, punchy, and warm. Like a smart friend explaining something over coffee—no BS, no jargon, just clear thinking. Gets to the point fast.

**Do This:**
- Keep sentences under 15 words
- End paragraphs with punchy 4-7 word statements
- Use "you" frequently—talk TO the reader
- Use contractions always
- State opinions directly without hedging

**Don't Do This:**
- No sentences over 20 words
- No "However," "Moreover," "Furthermore"
- No "I think" before opinions
- No passive voice
- No "utilize," "leverage," "facilitate"

**When Uncertain:**
- Shorter is better
- When in doubt, cut the adjective
- If a sentence feels too long, split it

### Voice DNA: Jordan Rivera
**Mode:** Essay / Long-form Non-Fiction
**Version:** 3 | Created: 2023-09-10 | Last Updated: 2024-02-20

---

#### Quick Reference

**Core Temperature:** Cool and measured—intellectually rigorous but not cold. Warmth emerges through precise observation, not emotional language.

**Sentence Signature:** Medium sentences (15-25 words) with occasional long complex sentences (30-40 words) for building arguments. Short sentences reserved for emphasis after complex points.

**Distinctive Moves:**
- Builds arguments through negation: "It's not X. It's not Y. It's Z."
- Uses parenthetical asides for secondary observations (often ironic)
- Ends sections with questions that open new territory
- Opens with concrete scenes or observations, never abstractions

**Never Does:**
- Starts with "In today's world" or similar throat-clearing
- Uses exclamation points (except in quoted dialogue)
- Writes in second person (almost never addresses reader as "you")
- Summarizes with "In conclusion" or "To sum up"

---

#### Voice Profile

**Sentence Level**
*Status: Strong*

Complex sentence architecture. Comfortable with dependent clauses, embedded qualifications, and parenthetical insertions. Sentences often have multiple parts but remain clear through careful punctuation and parallel structure.

Average: 20-22 words. Range: 6-45.

Characteristic pattern: Complex sentence (25-35 words) → Short punch (5-10 words) → Medium elaboration (15-20 words).

Example:
> "The assumption that technology inevitably improves our lives—an assumption so pervasive we rarely pause to examine it—collapses under even minimal scrutiny. The evidence is everywhere. We simply choose not to see it."

**Punctuation Personality**
*Status: Strong*

- Em-dashes: Moderate use, always for parenthetical insertions (pairs), rarely single
- Semicolons: Regular use for connecting related independent clauses
- Colons: For emphasis before key statements
- Parentheses: Frequent, for ironic asides or qualifications
- Exclamation points: Never (would feel like shouting)

**Paragraph & Structure**
*Status: Developed*

Longer paragraphs (5-8 sentences typical). Topic sentence usually first but sometimes delayed for effect. Paragraphs end with implications or questions, not summaries.

Transitions through concept-bridging rather than explicit markers. Never uses "However" or "Moreover"—instead, repeats a key word from previous paragraph or uses "But" or "And" to open.

**Word Choice & Vocabulary**
*Status: Strong*

Precise, somewhat elevated vocabulary. Comfortable with Latinate words when they're more precise ("epistemic" not "knowledge-related"). Avoids jargon but uses technical terms when appropriate, usually with subtle definition.

Favorite words/phrases: "precisely," "namely," "the trouble is," "what we miss," "consider"
Avoided: "impactful," "journey," "space" (as in "the wellness space"), "navigate"

Contractions: Selective. Uses them in casual moments to shift register. Formal arguments typically avoid them.

**Tone & Attitude**
*Status: Strong*

**Confidence:** High but not arrogant. States positions firmly but acknowledges limits of knowledge. Never hedges with "perhaps" or "arguably"—if uncertain, says so directly: "I don't know."

**Formality:** Elevated but accessible. Would not use slang but occasionally uses colloquialisms for contrast. Never stuffy.

**Authority stance:** Expert with humility. Teaches but doesn't lecture. Admits being wrong in the past. Positions self as someone who has thought carefully, not someone with final answers.

**Opening & Closing Moves**
*Status: Developed*

**Openings:** Always concrete—a scene, observation, or example. Never opens with abstraction, thesis statement, or "In today's world." Thesis emerges from opening scene/example.

Example opening:
> "Last Tuesday, I watched a man cross three lanes of traffic while staring at his phone. He didn't die. I kept watching him until he disappeared around a corner, still looking down."

**Closings:** Questions that open rather than summarize. Or concrete images that embody the argument. Never "In conclusion." Never restates thesis.

Example closing:
> "What would it mean to take that seriously? I'm not sure anyone knows. But I'm increasingly certain we'll have to find out."

**Signature Elements**
*Status: Developed*

- **Negation builds:** "It's not X. It's not Y either. It's something else entirely."
- **Parenthetical irony:** "(though calling it a 'solution' requires a certain optimism I can no longer muster)"
- **Late pivot:** Spends 80% of piece on one direction, then pivots to complicate in final 20%
- **Questions that expand:** Ends with questions that make the problem bigger, not smaller

#### Exemplar Passages

> "We tend to imagine attention as a resource we spend—as if each of us wakes with a fixed amount, depleting it through the day like fuel in a tank. This metaphor is comforting but wrong. Attention isn't a quantity; it's a relationship. And like all relationships, it can be damaged in ways that defy simple accounting."
>
> — *Demonstrates: Thesis through negation, medium-long sentences, metaphor examined and discarded, colon before key statement*

> "The trouble is not that we lack information—we are drowning in it—but that we have forgotten how to want less of it. (Or perhaps we never knew, and the scarcity that preceded abundance protected us from discovering our own appetites.)"
>
> — *Demonstrates: Parenthetical aside with ironic qualification, em-dash pairs, complex sentence with embedded clauses*

---

#### Anti-Patterns

| Pattern to Avoid | Why It's Wrong for Them |
|------------------|------------------------|
| "In today's fast-paced world" | Never opens with abstraction; always concrete |
| Exclamation points | Would feel like shouting; voice is measured |
| "You should..." | Rarely addresses reader directly |
| Bullet-point lists | Always prose, even for complex ideas |
| "In conclusion" | Never summarizes; ends with opening questions |
| "Journey" (metaphorical) | Avoided cliché |

**AI Patterns to Suppress:**
- [x] Significance puffery
- [x] "It's important to note"
- [x] "Despite challenges..." formula
- [x] "Rich tapestry"
- [x] Rule of three (unless deliberate)
- [x] False ranges ("from X to Y" without real scale)

---

#### Ghost Writer Briefing

**Voice Essence:**
A precise, measured intellectual voice. Cool but not cold. Builds arguments carefully through observation, complication, and occasional pivot. Thinks on the page without rushing to conclusions. Takes ideas seriously but not himself.

**Do This:**
- Open with concrete scenes or observations
- Build arguments through "It's not X, it's Y" structures
- Use parenthetical asides for ironic qualifications
- End sections with questions that expand, not close
- Vary sentence length: complex (25-35) → short punch (6-10) → medium (15-20)
- Use semicolons to connect related thoughts
- Use colons before important statements

**Don't Do This:**
- Never open with abstractions or "In today's world"
- Never use exclamation points
- Avoid "you" and second person
- Never use "In conclusion" or summarize at the end
- No bullet points—always prose
- Avoid "journey," "space," "impactful"
- Don't rush to conclusions; complicate instead

**When Uncertain:**
- Prefer the more precise word even if longer
- When making a point, first show what it's NOT
- End with questions rather than statements
- Complicate rather than simplify
- Trust the reader to follow complexity

**Structural Guidance:**
- Paragraphs: 5-8 sentences, end with implications
- Transitions: Through repeated concepts, not "However"
- Overall: Open concrete → Build argument → Pivot/complicate → End with question

### Voice DNA: Casey Morgan
**Mode:** Fiction (Literary Short Stories)
**Version:** 5 | Created: 2023-04-20 | Last Updated: 2024-03-10

---

#### Quick Reference

**Core Temperature:** Cool surface with emotional undercurrents. Restraint that implies depth. Rarely states feelings directly—shows through precise physical detail.

**Sentence Signature:** Medium-length declarative sentences. Subject-verb-object structure. Minimal adjectives. Heavy on concrete nouns and active verbs. Rhythm: regular pulse with occasional pauses created by fragments.

**Distinctive Moves:**
- Describes emotional states through physical sensations
- Uses object details as emotional indicators
- Dialogue without tags—action beats only
- Sentence fragments after complete sentences for emphasis
- Present tense throughout

**Never Does:**
- Adverbs (especially in dialogue: "she said angrily")
- Elaborate metaphors or similes
- Interior monologue in quotes
- Explaining what characters feel
- Backstory dumps

---

#### Voice Profile

**Sentence Level**
*Status: Strong*

Declarative, subject-verb-object dominant. Average 12-16 words. Maximum rarely exceeds 25. Almost never starts with dependent clauses.

Minimal modification—one adjective maximum per noun, and often zero. Prefers nouns that don't need adjectives ("oak" not "large tree").

Fragments used for rhythm: Complete sentence. Fragment. Complete sentence.

**Punctuation Personality**
*Status: Strong*

- Periods dominate. Short sentences separated by periods, not linked by commas.
- Em-dashes rare. Used only for interrupted dialogue or thought.
- No semicolons.
- No exclamation points except in rare dialogue.
- Quotation marks for dialogue only. Never for emphasis or "scare quotes."

**Word Choice & Vocabulary**
*Status: Strong*

**Nouns:** Concrete, specific, physical. "The kitchen" not "the room." "Coffee" not "drink." "Oak" not "tree."

**Verbs:** Active, physical, specific. "She pressed" not "she touched." "He dropped" not "he put down."

**Adjectives:** Minimal. One per noun maximum. Often zero. When used, physical rather than evaluative. "Cold coffee" not "terrible coffee."

**Adverbs:** Almost never. Especially not in dialogue attribution. No "she said quietly." Instead: "She said. Her voice barely reached him."

Favorite verbs: "pressed," "shifted," "held," "watched," "waited"
Avoided: anything that tells rather than shows feeling

**Paragraph & Structure**
*Status: Strong*

Short paragraphs in scenes—often 2-3 sentences. Longer paragraphs (5-7 sentences) only for sustained description.

Scene breaks: White space. No "Later that day" transitions. Jumps require reader inference.

Dialogue: Own paragraph for each speaker. Action beats instead of tags. No "he said/she said" when avoidable.

---

#### Register-Specific: Fiction Elements

**Narrative Distance**
*Status: Strong*

Close third, limited. Single POV character per scene. Never enters other characters' heads. POV character's sensations and observations only—no omniscient insights.

Interior thoughts: Rendered directly without italics or "she thought." Blend into narration.

> "She watched him leave. He would not come back. She knew this the way she knew rain was coming—something in the pressure, the quality of light."

**Dialogue Style**
*Status: Strong*

- **Tags:** Avoided. "Said" only when necessary. Never adverb-modified.
- **Beats:** Physical actions between lines.
- **Subtext:** Characters don't say what they mean. Meaning is in what's not said.
- **Dialect:** Never rendered phonetically. Register shifts through word choice.

Example:
> "You're leaving." She set her cup in the sink.
>
> "I have to."
>
> The water ran. She didn't turn it off.
>
> "When?"
>
> "Tomorrow."
>
> She turned off the water.

**Description Density**
*Status: Strong*

Sparse. Only details that matter—emotionally or for action. No atmospheric scene-setting for its own sake.

Objects carry weight. If an object is described, it matters. Chekhov's gun, always.

Physical over abstract. Weather is physical: "Rain hit the windows" not "It was a stormy night."

**Interiority Access**
*Status: Strong*

Limited. Physical sensations used for emotional states:
- Anger: "Her jaw tightened."
- Fear: "Something cold moved through her chest."
- Sadness: "The weight settled behind her eyes."

Never names the emotion directly in narration. The reader infers.

#### Exemplar Passages

> "She found him in the kitchen. He was holding a cup of coffee that had gone cold. She could tell by the way he held it—not drinking, just holding. The morning light came through the window and fell across his hands."
>
> — *Demonstrates: Concrete nouns, object as emotional indicator, physical detail carrying meaning, close third limited, no stated feelings*

> "They didn't talk about it. They talked about other things—the weather, the neighbor's dog, whether the gutters needed cleaning. The other thing stayed between them, a weight neither of them would lift."
>
> — *Demonstrates: Subtext, what's not said, emotional weight through metaphor (rare but controlled), dialogue summary rather than scene*

> "'I saw your mother yesterday.'
>
> He didn't look up. 'How is she.'
>
> 'The same.'
>
> He nodded. His hands stayed on the newspaper. She watched his hands."
>
> — *Demonstrates: Dialogue without tags, action beats, subtext, period instead of question mark for flat question, physical focus*

#### Anti-Patterns

| Pattern to Avoid | Why It's Wrong for Them |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Adverbs on dialogue | "Said quietly" etc.—never |
| Naming emotions | "She felt sad"—never; show physically |
| Metaphor clusters | One metaphor maximum per page |
| Backstory dumps | Information emerges through action/dialogue |
| Omniscient insights | Strict POV limits |
| Phonetic dialect | "Gonna" "wanna"—never |
| Italics for thoughts | Thoughts blend into narration |

**AI Patterns to Suppress:**
- [x] Evaluative adjectives ("terrible," "wonderful")
- [x] Adverbs (especially on dialogue)
- [x] Explaining feelings
- [x] Elaborate similes
- [x] Atmospheric description for its own sake
- [x] "She realized that..."
- [x] Backstory in narration

---

#### Ghost Writer Briefing

**Voice Essence:**
Restrained literary realism. Hemingway's iceberg—most meaning is below the surface. Physical details carry emotional weight. Characters act and speak; their feelings are inferred, not stated. Every sentence earns its place.

**Do This:**
- Physical details: concrete nouns, active verbs
- Show emotion through sensation: "Her chest tightened"
- Dialogue without tags—action beats between lines
- Close third limited—one consciousness per scene
- Short declarative sentences. Subject-verb-object.
- Objects as emotional indicators
- Present tense

**Don't Do This:**
- No adverbs, especially on dialogue tags
- Never name emotions: no "she felt angry"
- No elaborate metaphors or similes
- No omniscient narration
- No phonetic dialect
- No backstory dumps
- No "she realized" or "she knew"
- No italics for interior thoughts

**When Uncertain:**
- Cut the adjective
- Cut the adverb
- Make it physical, not abstract
- If you can delete a word, delete it
- If in doubt, the character doesn't say it—subtext

**Sentence-Level Guidance:**
- Average: 12-16 words
- Structure: Subject-verb-object dominant
- Fragments: After complete sentences for emphasis
- Rhythm: Regular pulse with occasional pauses

**Dialogue Guidance:**
- No tags when speaker is clear
- "Said" only when necessary, never modified
- Action beats between lines
- What they don't say matters more

*Annotation: This is a fully developed profile ready for high-accuracy ghost writing. All dimensions have high confidence. Register-specific elements (fiction) are thoroughly captured. Multiple examples demonstrate each pattern. Anti-patterns are comprehensive. The profile has been validated against actual ghost writer output and refined based on feedback. This is the target state for Voice DNA Documents.*

## Key Takeaways

1. **Specificity is everything.** Vague descriptions produce vague output. "Short punchy sentences (8-15 words) ending paragraphs" beats "uses varied sentence lengths."

2. **Examples demonstrate patterns.** Include quotes from the writer's work that show patterns in action.

3. **Anti-patterns are half the picture.** What they don't do is as important as what they do.

4. **Ghost Writer Briefing must be actionable.** Someone should be able to follow it without reading the full profile.

5. **Development takes time.** A minimum viable profile gets you started; a strong profile takes multiple sessions and validation.

6. **Register matters.** Fiction, non-fiction, and blog writing have different relevant dimensions. Capture what's appropriate to the mode.

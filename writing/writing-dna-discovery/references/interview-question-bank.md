# Interview Question Bank

Questions organized by purpose and dimension. Use these during collaborative discovery to surface voice patterns that samples alone might not reveal.

**Core Principle:** One question at a time. Never stack questions or overwhelm.

## Using This Bank

1. **Don't read questions verbatim** — Use these as starting points, then adapt to the conversation.

2. **One at a time** — Never stack questions. Ask, listen, follow up.

3. **Follow the energy** — If a question sparks insight, go deeper there.

4. **Mix types** — Alternate between direct questions, comparative choices, and clarifying follow-ups.

5. **Validate findings** — Circle back: "So what I'm hearing is... Does that sound right?"

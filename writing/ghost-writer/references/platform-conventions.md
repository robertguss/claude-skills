# Platform Conventions

Platform-specific considerations for different publishing contexts.

---

## Purpose

Each platform has conventions shaped by how people use it. This guide covers platform-specific adjustments while maintaining the writer's authentic voice.

**Priority:** DNA document defines voice. Platform conventions shape format, not personality.

---

## LinkedIn

### Platform Characteristics

- Professional audience
- Mobile-first reading
- "See more" truncation after ~210 characters
- Algorithm favors engagement
- Comments are visible and matter

### Format Conventions

**The Hook Line:**
The first line must work before "see more":

> "I got fired yesterday. Best thing that ever happened."

**Line Breaks:**
Use generous line breaks—one sentence per line is common:

```
I spent 10 years chasing the wrong goal.

Last month, I stopped.

Here's what I learned.
```

**Length:**

- Short posts: 100-300 words
- Standard posts: 300-700 words
- Long posts: 700-1,300 words (max ~3,000 characters)

**Structure:**

- Hook
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Takeaway or question at end

### Voice Adjustments

**Do:**

- Maintain DNA voice
- Adapt to professional context
- Use "I" (LinkedIn is personal)
- Include specific details (numbers, outcomes)

**Don't:**

- Become generic "thought leader"
- Lose personality for professionalism
- Use corporate jargon unless DNA includes it

### Closing

End with:

- A question that invites comments
- A call to action (follow, share, DM)
- A simple takeaway

## Newsletter

### Platform Characteristics

- Subscribers chose to receive
- Email inbox = competitive attention
- Subject line determines open
- Personal relationship over time
- Consistent voice expected

### Format Conventions

**Subject Line:**

- Clear value or curiosity
- Under 50 characters ideal
- Match the DNA's tone

**Opening:**

- Often personal/direct
- Acknowledge the reader relationship
- Quick hook into content

**Length:**

- Quick update: 300-500 words
- Standard issue: 600-1,000 words
- Deep dive: 1,500-2,500 words

**Structure:**
Common patterns:

- One big idea + exploration
- 3-5 curated links with commentary
- Personal reflection + lesson
- Behind-the-scenes + takeaway

### Voice Adjustments

**Do:**

- Maintain DNA voice consistently across issues
- Be more personal than other formats (they invited you)
- Reference previous issues / running themes
- Use subscriber's name if available and appropriate

**Don't:**

- Change voice issue to issue
- Be overly formal (they subscribed to a person)
- Forget the relationship aspect

### Closing

Consistent sign-off that becomes recognizable:

- Signature phrase
- CTA for reply/feedback
- Preview of next issue

## Twitter/X

### Platform Characteristics

- Character limits (280 per tweet)
- Threads for longer content
- Fast-moving, high competition
- Quote tweets and replies matter
- Personality wins

### Format Conventions

**Single Tweets:**

- Complete thought in 280 characters
- No wasted words
- Hook or insight or question

**Threads:**

- Tweet 1: Hook that stands alone
- Subsequent tweets: One point each
- Final tweet: Summary or CTA
- Number them (1/, 2/, etc.) or use implicit flow

**Thread Length:**

- Short thread: 3-5 tweets
- Standard thread: 6-10 tweets
- Long thread: 11-15 tweets (max for retention)

### Voice Adjustments

**Do:**

- Compress DNA patterns (shorter sentences)
- Keep distinctive voice markers
- More direct, less qualified

**Don't:**

- Become generic Twitter voice
- Lose the writer's personality
- Over-thread (not everything needs 20 tweets)

### Techniques

**The Hook Tweet:**

> "I spent 5 years building the wrong thing. Here's what I wish I knew:"

**The Thread Payoff:**
Final tweet should land, not trail off.

**Standalone Tweets:**
If thread isn't needed, make a great single tweet.

## Platform-Agnostic Principles

### Voice Consistency Across Platforms

The writer's voice should be recognizable across platforms, adapted but not transformed:

- LinkedIn post sounds like the same person as their blog
- Tweets are compressed, but same personality
- Newsletter is same voice, more intimate

### DNA Takes Priority

If platform convention conflicts with DNA document:

- DNA usually wins
- Note the tension in draft notes
- User can decide

### Adaptation vs. Abandonment

**Adaptation (good):**

- Shorter sentences for Twitter
- More personal opening for newsletter
- Professional framing for LinkedIn

**Abandonment (bad):**

- Losing all personality for LinkedIn
- Becoming generic "thread person" on Twitter
- Formality replacing warmth in email

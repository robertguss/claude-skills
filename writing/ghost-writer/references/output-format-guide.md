# Output Format Guide

How to structure ghost writer output for clarity and usefulness.

---

## Purpose

Consistent output format helps the user:

- Quickly assess confidence and context
- Read drafts without interruption
- Understand your decisions and reasoning
- Compare options meaningfully
- Provide useful feedback

---

## Complete Output Structure

Every ghost writer output follows this structure:

1. Confidence Header
2. Draft A (headlines + content)
3. Draft A Notes
4. Draft B (headlines + content)
5. Draft B Notes
6. Comparison Summary
7. Consistency Check (long pieces only)

---

## Section 1: Confidence Header

**Purpose:** Set expectations before the user reads the drafts.

### Format

```markdown
## Confidence Assessment

**Profile Readiness:** [Minimum Viable / Solid / Strong]
**Profile Freshness:** Created [Month Year], [X months] ago
**Estimated Accuracy:** ~[X]%
**Key Uncertainties:** [List specific dimensions or patterns where you had to infer]
```

### Content Guidelines

**Profile Readiness**

- Use the exact level from the DNA document's Profile Metadata
- If DNA document doesn't specify, assess yourself:
  - Minimum Viable: Basic patterns, some gaps
  - Solid: Most dimensions developed, briefing complete
  - Strong: Comprehensive, validated

**Profile Freshness**

- Calculate from the "Created" or "Last Updated" date
- Flag if older than 6 months: "Note: Profile may benefit from refresh"

**Estimated Accuracy**

- Base on readiness level:
  - Minimum Viable: ~60-70%
  - Solid: ~75-85%
  - Strong: ~85-90%
- Adjust for specific gaps or challenges

**Key Uncertainties**

- List 2-5 specific areas where:
  - DNA document had "Emerging" or "Not Assessed" status
  - You had to infer patterns
  - The task pushed into undocumented territory

### Example

```markdown
## Confidence Assessment

**Profile Readiness:** Solid
**Profile Freshness:** Created August 2024, 4 months ago
**Estimated Accuracy:** ~80%
**Key Uncertainties:** Humor placement (Emerging status), technical jargon density (not addressed in DNA), closing style for this format (limited examples)
```

---

## Section 2: Draft A

**Purpose:** First complete, readable draft.

### Format

```markdown
## Draft A: [Brief Descriptor]

### Headlines

1. [Headline option 1]
2. [Headline option 2]
3. [Headline option 3]

### Content

[Clean prose—no inline comments, no interruptions, readable as a complete piece]
```

### Content Guidelines

**Brief Descriptor**

- 2-5 words describing the approach
- Examples: "Analytical Deep-Dive," "Personal Narrative," "Direct & Punchy," "Exploratory Essay"

**Headlines**

- Always 3 options (unless 2 is specifically appropriate)
- Follow DNA document headline patterns if documented
- If not documented, offer variety:
  - One direct/descriptive
  - One curiosity-driven or question-based
  - One benefit-focused or provocative

**Content**

- Clean, uninterrupted prose
- No bracketed comments unless research placeholders: `[STAT: specific data needed]`
- Fully readable as a standalone piece
- Complete—don't trail off or abbreviate

---

## Section 3: Draft A Notes

**Purpose:** Explain your decisions and flag uncertainties.

### Format

```markdown
## Draft A Notes

**Approach:** [1-2 sentences on the strategy for this draft]

**Patterns Applied:**

- [Pattern name]: [How it was applied, with brief example from draft]
- [Pattern name]: [How it was applied] — _inferred_
- [Pattern name]: [How it was applied]

**Decisions Made:**

- [Decision point]: [What you chose and why]
- [Decision point]: [What you chose and why]

**Uncertainties:**

- [Area]: [What you did and why, given the gap in documentation]
```

### Content Guidelines

**Approach**

- Explain the strategic choice for this draft
- How does it interpret the voice?
- What aspect of the voice does it emphasize?

**Patterns Applied**

- List 4-6 key patterns you applied
- Give a brief example from the draft for each
- Mark inferred patterns with "— _inferred_"
- Be specific: "Short sentences averaging 12 words" not just "Short sentences"

**Decisions Made**

- List 2-4 meaningful choices
- Explain the reasoning
- Reference DNA document where applicable

**Uncertainties**

- List 1-3 areas where you lacked clear guidance
- Explain what you did and why
- Be honest—this helps the user review efficiently

### Example

```markdown
## Draft A Notes

**Approach:** Leads with the personal angle, building to the analytical point. Emphasizes conversational warmth.

**Patterns Applied:**

- Short sentences (avg 14 words): "The code worked. Then it didn't. Three hours later, I found the bug hiding in plain sight."
- Direct address ("you"): Used frequently as per DNA, e.g., "You've probably seen this yourself."
- Anglo-Saxon vocabulary: Chose "start" over "commence," "help" over "facilitate"
- Em-dash for pivot: "I thought I understood—I didn't." — _inferred frequency_

**Decisions Made:**

- Opening with anecdote: DNA shows preference for scene-setting; chose personal story over thesis-first
- Length: Erred toward abundance (~1,400 words) per general guidance

**Uncertainties:**

- Technical jargon: DNA doesn't specify. Used sparingly with brief explanations. Review if too much/little.
- Closing: Limited examples in DNA. Ended with question callback to opening.
```

## Section 4: Draft B

**Purpose:** A meaningfully different second option.

### Format

Same as Draft A:

```markdown
## Draft B: [Brief Descriptor—how it differs from A]

### Headlines

1. [Headline option 1]
2. [Headline option 2]
3. [Headline option 3]

### Content

[Clean prose]
```

### Content Guidelines

**Brief Descriptor**

- Should contrast with Draft A
- Make the difference clear: "Analytical & Direct" vs. Draft A's "Personal Narrative"

**Headlines**

- Different from Draft A options
- Should fit this draft's approach

**Content**

- Meaningfully different from Draft A—not just minor word changes
- Different structure, opening, emphasis, or angle
- Same voice, different execution

---

## Section 5: Draft B Notes

**Purpose:** Explain how and why Draft B differs.

### Format

Same structure as Draft A Notes, but emphasize differences:

```markdown
## Draft B Notes

**Approach:** [How this differs from Draft A]

**Patterns Applied:**
[Same structure—note any patterns emphasized differently]

**Decisions Made:**
[Same structure—note different choices]

**Uncertainties:**
[Same structure—may share some with A, may have unique ones]
```

---

## Section 6: Comparison Summary

**Purpose:** Help the user choose between drafts and understand the trade-offs.

### Format

```markdown
## Comparison

**Draft A emphasizes:** [Aspects of voice, approach, or topic]
**Draft B emphasizes:** [Aspects of voice, approach, or topic]

**When to use A:** [Situations, audiences, or goals where A fits better]
**When to use B:** [Situations, audiences, or goals where B fits better]

**Observations:** [Honest perspective—concerns, suggestions, tensions you noticed]
```

### Content Guidelines

**Emphasizes**

- Be specific about what each draft prioritizes
- Voice aspects: warmth, directness, formality
- Approach: narrative vs. analytical, personal vs. objective
- Topic handling: depth vs. breadth, example-heavy vs. concept-focused

**When to use**

- Practical guidance
- Specific scenarios where each draft shines
- Audience considerations

**Observations**

- This is where you share perspective even if not asked
- Honest concerns: "Both drafts may be too long for mobile readers"
- Suggestions: "You might combine A's opening with B's structure"
- Tensions: "The topic pushed toward formality; your voice is casual—I leaned casual but review carefully"

### Example

```markdown
## Comparison

**Draft A emphasizes:** Warmth and personal connection. Opens with story, builds analytical point gradually.
**Draft B emphasizes:** Authority and directness. Opens with thesis, supports with evidence, personal touches woven in.

**When to use A:** If your audience values connection over efficiency. Blog context. Readers with time.
**When to use B:** If readers want the point fast. Newsletter or LinkedIn. Busy professionals.

**Observations:** Draft A is more "you" based on exemplar passages, but Draft B might fit this topic better—it's technical enough to warrant directness. Consider A's opening with B's structure. Also, both are ~1,400 words—if length is a concern, let me know and I'll trim.
```

## Section 7: Consistency Check (Long Pieces Only)

**Purpose:** Flag voice drift in pieces over 2,000 words.

### Format

```markdown
## Consistency Check

**Voice consistency:** [Overall assessment]

**Sections that may have drifted:**

- [Section/paragraph range]: [What feels different and why]

**Rhythm notes:** [Any monotony concerns]

**Recommendation:** [Specific areas worth reviewing]
```

### When to Include

- Only for pieces over ~2,000 words
- Optional for pieces 1,500-2,000 words if complex structure

### Content Guidelines

**Voice consistency**

- Overall assessment: consistent, minor drift, or notable drift

**Sections that may have drifted**

- Identify specific sections
- Explain what feels different
- Suggest why (topic shift, fatigue, complexity)

**Rhythm notes**

- Flag monotonous stretches
- Note any lack of sentence/paragraph variation

**Recommendation**

- Actionable guidance
- Which sections to review most carefully

---

## Formatting Rules

### Markdown Usage

- Use `##` for main sections
- Use `###` for subsections within drafts
- Use `**bold**` for labels and emphasis
- Use `-` for bullet lists
- Use `>` for block quotes from the draft (sparingly)
- Use `` `code` `` for research placeholders only

### Length Guidelines

| Section           | Target Length              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| Confidence Header | 4-6 lines                  |
| Draft Descriptor  | 2-5 words                  |
| Headlines         | 3 options, each 5-12 words |
| Draft Content     | As needed by task          |
| Draft Notes       | 150-300 words              |
| Comparison        | 100-200 words              |
| Consistency Check | 50-150 words               |

### Clarity Principles

- **Headlines section clearly labeled** — Easy to find and review
- **Content section is clean** — No interruptions, readable as a piece
- **Notes are structured** — Scannable with clear labels
- **Comparison is comparative** — Explicitly contrasts A and B

---

## Adapting for Special Cases

### Very Short Pieces (under 300 words)

- May reduce to 2 headline options
- Notes can be briefer (100-150 words)
- Comparison can be more concise

### Very Long Pieces (over 3,000 words)

- Always include Consistency Check
- Consider section-by-section delivery
- Notes may be more detailed

### Technical Content

- More emphasis on accuracy notes
- Research placeholders clearly formatted
- May include terminology notes in comparison

### Multiple Audience Versions

- If drafts are for different audiences, structure as:
  - Draft A: For [Audience X]
  - Draft B: For [Audience Y]
- Comparison focuses on audience fit, not just approach

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Interrupting draft content** — No inline comments, keep it clean
2. **Vague descriptors** — "Good version" vs. "Analytical Deep-Dive"
3. **Missing uncertainty notes** — Always flag where you inferred
4. **Shallow comparison** — "A is longer" isn't useful; explain implications
5. **No honest observations** — Share your perspective, even concerns
6. **Inconsistent formatting** — Same structure every time

---

## Summary

Good output format is:

- **Consistent** — Same structure every time
- **Clear** — User can quickly find what they need
- **Honest** — Confidence, uncertainties, and concerns are visible
- **Useful** — Enables good decision-making and efficient revision

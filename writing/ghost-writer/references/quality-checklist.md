# Quality Checklist

Pre-delivery verification for ghost writer drafts.

---

## Purpose

Run through this checklist before delivering drafts. Catching issues before delivery is better than revising after.

## Voice Fidelity Checks

### Pattern Application

- [ ] **Sentence rhythm matches DNA** — Length patterns, variation, internal structure
- [ ] **Punctuation matches DNA** — Em-dashes, semicolons, comma density as documented
- [ ] **Word choice matches DNA** — Vocabulary level, favorites used, avoided words absent
- [ ] **Tone matches DNA** — Emotional temperature, formality level consistent
- [ ] **Reader relationship matches DNA** — "I" frequency, "you" usage, authority stance

### Ghost Writer Briefing Compliance

- [ ] **"Do This" items applied** — Each instruction followed where applicable
- [ ] **"Don't Do This" items avoided** — No violations
- [ ] **"When Uncertain" rules used** — Ambiguous decisions followed rules
- [ ] **Sentence-level guidance followed** — Length, opening patterns, emphasis
- [ ] **Structural guidance followed** — Paragraph length, transitions, opening/closing

### Anti-Pattern Suppression

- [ ] **DNA-specific anti-patterns avoided** — None present
- [ ] **AI patterns suppressed** — No baseline AI tells
- [ ] **Quick scan for AI tells** — "Delve," "leverage," "rich tapestry," etc. absent

## Craft Quality Checks

### Opening

- [ ] **Strong first sentence** — Engaging, not throat-clearing
- [ ] **Hook present** — Reader drawn in
- [ ] **Opening matches DNA pattern** — Documented opening style used
- [ ] **No "In today's world..." or similar** — AI tell avoided

### Body

- [ ] **Clear progression** — Logical flow from point to point
- [ ] **Transitions smooth** — Paragraphs connect naturally
- [ ] **No tangents** — Stays focused on core message
- [ ] **Sufficient depth** — Not superficial

### Closing

- [ ] **Strong last sentence** — Memorable, not weak
- [ ] **Closing matches DNA pattern** — Documented closing style used
- [ ] **Opening/closing resonance** — Echo or complete each other if appropriate
- [ ] **No "In conclusion..."** — AI tell avoided

### Rhythm and Variation

- [ ] **Sentence length varies** — Not monotonous
- [ ] **Paragraph length varies** — Not all same size
- [ ] **First/last sentences strong** — Carry weight
- [ ] **No stacked same-length sentences** — More than 3 similar in a row

### Word Level

- [ ] **Active voice dominant** — Unless DNA shows passive preference
- [ ] **Strong verbs** — Not propped up by adverbs
- [ ] **Concrete over abstract** — Unless DNA shows abstract preference
- [ ] **No unnecessary hedging** — "Very," "really," "somewhat" minimal

---

## Content Checks

### Accuracy

- [ ] **Research placeholders marked** — `[STAT: ...]` format for unverified data
- [ ] **No made-up facts** — Nothing presented as true without verification
- [ ] **Claims proportionate to evidence** — Not overstating

### Completeness

- [ ] **All key points covered** — Nothing major missing
- [ ] **Appropriate depth** — Not too shallow, not over-detailed
- [ ] **Length appropriate** — Within range for format and task

### Audience Fit

- [ ] **Expertise level right** — Matches DNA's reader assumptions
- [ ] **Jargon handled correctly** — Defined or avoided as DNA specifies
- [ ] **Tone appropriate for audience** — Professional/casual as needed

---

## Format-Specific Checks

### Blog Posts

- [ ] **Scannable structure** — Headers, short paragraphs
- [ ] **Hook in opening** — Reader engagement early
- [ ] **Value delivered** — Reader gets something useful
- [ ] **Call-to-action if appropriate** — Matches DNA pattern

### Newsletters

- [ ] **Personal connection** — Writer present
- [ ] **Quick value** — Respect for reader's time
- [ ] **Consistent voice** — Matches newsletter persona

### Essays/Long-Form

- [ ] **Argument clear** — Thesis evident
- [ ] **Evidence integrated** — Supports claims
- [ ] **Counterarguments addressed** — If appropriate
- [ ] **Satisfying conclusion** — Resolves tension

### LinkedIn

- [ ] **Hook in first line** — Before "see more"
- [ ] **Professional but personable** — Platform fit
- [ ] **Line breaks for readability** — Mobile-friendly

---

## Draft Differentiation Check

- [ ] **Drafts meaningfully different** — Not just minor word changes
- [ ] **Different approaches clear** — Descriptor captures difference
- [ ] **Both viable** — User could choose either
- [ ] **Difference serves user** — Not difference for its own sake

---

## Output Format Checks

### Confidence Header

- [ ] **Profile readiness stated** — Minimum Viable / Solid / Strong
- [ ] **Profile freshness noted** — Age flagged if >6 months
- [ ] **Estimated accuracy given** — Based on readiness
- [ ] **Key uncertainties listed** — 2-5 specific areas

### Headlines

- [ ] **3 options per draft** — Unless very short piece
- [ ] **Variety in approaches** — Direct, curiosity, benefit
- [ ] **Match DNA patterns** — If headline style documented

### Draft Notes

- [ ] **Approach explained** — Clear strategy for this draft
- [ ] **Patterns listed** — With examples
- [ ] **Inferred patterns marked** — "— *inferred*"
- [ ] **Decisions explained** — With reasoning
- [ ] **Uncertainties flagged** — What you did and why

### Comparison

- [ ] **Emphasizes difference** — What each draft prioritizes
- [ ] **When-to-use guidance** — Practical direction
- [ ] **Honest observations** — Concerns, suggestions, tensions

### Consistency Check (if applicable)

- [ ] **Included for long pieces** — 2,000+ words
- [ ] **Drift flagged** — Specific sections noted
- [ ] **Rhythm assessed** — Monotony concerns raised
- [ ] **Recommendations given** — Where to review

---

## Final Review

### Read-Through Test

- [ ] **Read Draft A aloud** (mentally) — Does it sound like them?
- [ ] **Read Draft B aloud** (mentally) — Does it sound like them?
- [ ] **Would this pass the "is this them?" test?** — If handed to someone who knows the writer

### Honest Assessment

- [ ] **Confident in this output?** — If not, why not?
- [ ] **Any lingering concerns?** — Note in Comparison
- [ ] **Anything unsaid that should be said?** — Add to Observations

## Quick Pre-Delivery Scan

Before hitting send, quick check:

1. **Both drafts complete?** ✓
2. **Confidence header honest?** ✓
3. **AI tells absent?** ✓
4. **Voice feels right?** ✓
5. **Notes transparent?** ✓
6. **Comparison helpful?** ✓

If all yes: Deliver.

If any no: Fix before delivering.

## Common Issues to Catch

| Issue | How to Spot | How to Fix |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| AI-sounding opening | "In today's world...", "It's important to note..." | Rewrite in their voice |
| Monotonous rhythm | 5+ similar-length sentences in a row | Vary sentence length |
| Wrong formality | Too stiff or too casual for DNA | Adjust temperature |
| Missing voice markers | No signature elements | Add documented distinctive moves |
| Weak closing | Trails off, generic conclusion | Strengthen with DNA pattern |
| Excessive hedging | "Somewhat," "perhaps," "might" overused | Cut or commit |
| Passive voice heavy | "Was done by," "has been seen" | Activate verbs |
| Jargon mismatch | Too much/little technical language | Match DNA guidance |

## When to Revise Before Delivery

**Always revise if:**
- Any AI tell detected
- Voice feels noticeably off
- Missing major content element
- Drafts aren't meaningfully different

**Consider revising if:**
- Minor rhythm issues
- One section feels weaker
- Uncertainty about a pattern choice

**Okay to deliver and note if:**
- DNA document has gaps you worked around
- Topic pushed into undocumented territory
- Minor concerns that user can address in revision

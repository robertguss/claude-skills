# Elements of Style

Core principles from Strunk & White's classic, distilled for ghost writing.

---

## Purpose

These principles provide a craft foundation when the DNA document doesn't give specific guidance. They represent widely-accepted standards of clear, effective prose.

**Important:** The DNA document takes precedence. If a writer's documented voice violates these principles (e.g., they love adverbs), follow the DNA.

## The Core Principles

### 1. Omit Needless Words

Vigorous writing is concise. Every word should do work.

**Cuts to Make:**

| Wordy                                | Concise                     |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| the question as to whether           | whether                     |
| there is no doubt but that           | no doubt / doubtless        |
| used for fuel purposes               | used for fuel               |
| he is a man who                      | he                          |
| in a hasty manner                    | hastily                     |
| this is a subject that               | this subject                |
| the reason why is that               | because                     |
| owing to the fact that               | since / because             |
| in spite of the fact that            | though / although           |
| call your attention to the fact that | remind you / notify you     |
| I was unaware of the fact that       | I was unaware / didn't know |
| the fact that he had not succeeded   | his failure                 |
| the fact that I had arrived          | my arrival                  |

**Principle in Action:**

- Cut "that" when the sentence works without it
- Cut "very" almost always
- Cut "really" almost always
- Cut filler phrases entirely

**Example:**

> Wordy: "He is the kind of person who is always looking for ways in which he can improve himself."
> Concise: "He always seeks self-improvement."

### 2. Use Active Voice

Active voice is direct and vigorous. Passive voice is indirect and often weak.

**Active vs. Passive:**

| Passive                                  | Active                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| The ball was thrown by John              | John threw the ball     |
| It was decided that                      | We decided              |
| The meeting was attended by fifty people | Fifty people attended   |
| The results were analyzed                | We analyzed the results |

**When Passive Is Acceptable:**

- When the actor is unknown: "The building was constructed in 1890"
- When the actor is unimportant: "The data was collected over three years"
- When passive matches the DNA document

**Detection:**
Forms of "to be" + past participle often signal passive:

- was decided
- is being considered
- has been shown
- will be completed

---

### 3. Put Statements in Positive Form

Make definite assertions. Avoid weak, evasive, or noncommittal language.

**Negative vs. Positive:**

| Negative/Weak                             | Positive/Strong                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| He was not very often on time             | He usually arrived late                  |
| She did not think studying was worthwhile | She thought studying was a waste of time |
| not honest                                | dishonest                                |
| not important                             | unimportant / trivial                    |
| did not remember                          | forgot                                   |
| did not pay attention                     | ignored                                  |
| did not have much confidence in           | distrusted                               |

**"Not" as Evasion:**
Using "not" often shows unwillingness to commit:

> Weak: "The report was not inaccurate."
> Strong: "The report was accurate." (or was it?)

---

### 4. Use Definite, Specific, Concrete Language

Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract.

**Abstract vs. Concrete:**

| Abstract                        | Concrete                            |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| A period of unfavorable weather | It rained every day for a week      |
| He showed satisfaction          | He grinned                          |
| Transportation was provided     | A bus picked us up                  |
| The situation was complicated   | Three departments claimed authority |

**General vs. Specific:**

| General            | Specific      |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| a large number     | 847           |
| in the near future | next Tuesday  |
| a long time ago    | in 1989       |
| some kind of bird  | a mockingbird |

---

### 5. Avoid a Succession of Loose Sentences

Variety in sentence structure prevents monotony.

**Loose Sentences:**
A loose sentence states its main point and then adds modifying elements:

> "The sun set, casting long shadows across the field, turning the sky orange and pink."

**Problem:**
Stringing together loose sentences creates a mechanical rhythm:

> "The sun set. The shadows grew long. The sky turned colors. The birds returned to their nests."

**Solution:**

- Vary sentence structure
- Combine related ideas
- Use subordination
- Change sentence length

---

### 6. Express Co-ordinate Ideas in Similar Form

Parallel constructions express parallel ideas.

**Faulty Parallelism:**

> "She likes hiking, swimming, and to ride bikes."

**Parallel:**

> "She likes hiking, swimming, and biking."

**More Examples:**

| Faulty                                                                      | Parallel                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| He is smart, hardworking, and has a good sense of humor                     | He is smart, hardworking, and humorous                             |
| The project requires patience, careful planning, and you need determination | The project requires patience, careful planning, and determination |

**Correlatives Must Be Parallel:**

- not only... but also
- either... or
- neither... nor
- both... and

> Faulty: "Not only did she finish the project but also she presented it."
> Parallel: "She not only finished the project but also presented it."

---

### 7. Keep Related Words Together

Subjects and verbs, verbs and objects, modifiers and modified—keep them close.

**Muddled:**

> "He noticed a large stain in the rug that was right in the center."
> (Is the stain or the rug in the center?)

**Clear:**

> "He noticed a large stain right in the center of the rug."

**Modifiers:**
Place modifiers as close as possible to the words they modify:

> Confusing: "I only drink coffee in the morning."
> Clear: "I drink coffee only in the morning." (or "I drink only coffee in the morning.")

---

### 8. Use the Right Word

Confused words weaken prose.

**Common Confusions:**

| Word      | Meaning                              | Not                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| affect    | to influence (verb)                  | effect (noun: result)    |
| effect    | result (noun); to bring about (verb) | affect                   |
| comprise  | include, contain                     | "is comprised of"        |
| imply     | to suggest                           | infer (to deduce)        |
| fewer     | countable items                      | less (uncountable)       |
| literally | actually happened                    | figuratively             |
| unique    | one of a kind                        | very unique (no degrees) |
| nauseous  | causing nausea                       | nauseated (feeling sick) |

**When in Doubt:**
Use the simpler word. "Use" beats "utilize." "Start" beats "commence." "Help" beats "facilitate."

---

### 9. Write with Nouns and Verbs

Nouns and verbs are the essential parts of speech. Adjectives and adverbs add color but can weaken.

**Adverb Crutches:**

| Weak          | Strong    |
| ------------- | --------- |
| ran quickly   | sprinted  |
| said quietly  | whispered |
| walked slowly | ambled    |
| very tired    | exhausted |

**Adjective Inflation:**

| Overwritten                | Simple                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| beautiful, stunning sunset | the sunset (let context add beauty) |
| completely unique          | unique                              |
| extremely crucial          | crucial                             |

**The Test:**
Can the sentence work without the adjective/adverb? If yes, cut it.

---

### 10. Revise and Rewrite

Writing is rewriting. The first draft is never the final draft.

**In Ghost Writing Context:**

- The first draft aims for 80% accuracy
- The human does the final 20%
- But the ghost writer should still self-edit before delivering
- Catch AI patterns, rhythm issues, and voice drift

---

## Application for Ghost Writing

### When DNA Document Is Silent

Use these principles as defaults:

- Active voice
- Concise construction
- Concrete language
- Positive statements
- Varied sentence structure

### When DNA Document Contradicts

Follow the DNA. If the writer loves adverbs, use adverbs. If they prefer passive voice in certain contexts, match that. Voice fidelity trumps general rules.

### For Self-Editing

Before delivering:

1. Scan for needless words → cut
2. Scan for passive → consider activating
3. Scan for vague language → make concrete
4. Scan for monotonous rhythm → vary
5. Check parallelism in lists

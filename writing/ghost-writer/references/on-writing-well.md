## I. The Philosophy of Good Writing

### 1. The Transaction (Humanity)

- **The Definition:** Good writing is a personal transaction between two people: the writer and the reader. It is conducted on paper (or screen), but it must retain humanity.
- **The Product:** Ultimately, the product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but _who they are_.
- **Enthusiasm:** The most compelling element of nonfiction is the writer's enthusiasm. A writer can make a dull subject interesting if they are genuinely engaged with it.
- **Vulnerability:** Good writing requires a shedding of "stiffness." The writer must find the real person behind the tension.

### 2. Simplicity (The Core Doctrine)

- **The Disease:** Clutter is the disease of writing. American society is strangling in unnecessary words, circular constructions, and meaningless jargon.
- **The Solution:** Strip every sentence to its cleanest components.
  - Delete every word that serves no function.
  - Replace long words with short words.
  - Remove adverbs that carry the same meaning as the verb (e.g., "blared loudly").
  - Remove passive constructions that leave the reader unsure of who is doing what.
- **The Mindset:** Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one cannot exist without the other. If the reader is lost, it is because the writer has not been careful enough.
- **The Test:** Constantly ask: _What am I trying to say?_ Then read what you wrote and ask: _Have I said it?_

### 3. Clutter (Specific Enemies)

- **Prepositions:** Avoid draping verbs with unnecessary prepositions (e.g., "head up" → "head", "face up to" → "face", "free up" → "free").
- **Adjectives:** Eliminate useless adjectives (e.g., "personal friend," "personal feeling").
- **Pompous Phrases:** Replace laborious phrases with short words:
  - "At the present time" / "Currently" → **"Now"**
  - "Experiencing precipitation" → **"Raining"**
  - "Sufficient" → **"Enough"**
  - "Attempt" → **"Try"**
  - "Referred to as" → **"Called"**
- **Jargon:** Beware of words like "paradigm," "parameter," "prioritize," and "interface." They smother the voice.
- **The Bracket Exercise:** To self-edit, put brackets around every component in a piece of writing that isn't doing useful work. Most first drafts can be cut by 50% without losing information or voice.

## II. The Writer's Voice

### 1. Style

- **Definition:** Style is not a garnish you add to writing; it is organic to the person doing the writing. "Style is who you are."
- **The Rule:** **Be yourself.** Readers want the person talking to them to sound genuine.
- **Relaxation:** Writers often tighten up when they try to sound "authoritative." The goal is to relax and have confidence.
- **The First Person:** Writers are most natural when using "I".
  - _Guideline:_ Unless strictly forbidden by the format, use "I", "me", "we", and "us". It warms up impersonal prose.
  - _Defense:_ "Who am I to say what I think?" -> "There is only one you. Nobody else thinks or feels in exactly the same way."

### 2. The Audience

- **Who are you writing for?** You are writing for **yourself**.
  - _Paradox:_ You must master the craft to not lose the reader (don't be sloppy), but your attitude should be to please yourself.
  - _Reasoning:_ If you write with enjoyment, you will entertain the readers worth writing for. If you lose the dullards, you didn't want them anyway.
- **Authenticity:** Never say anything in writing that you wouldn't comfortably say in conversation. Avoid words like "indeed," "moreover," or calling a person an "individual."

### 3. Words and Usage

- **Journalese:** Avoid the quilt of instant words patched together (e.g., "beef up," "upcoming," "notables," "greats").
- **Rhythm:** Readers "hear" what they are reading in their inner ear. Sound, rhythm, and alliteration are vital.
  - _Tip:_ Read sentences aloud. If they are plodding, vary the sentence length. An occasional short sentence carries a tremendous punch.
- **The Thesaurus:** Use it to jog the memory, not to find fancy words.
- **Usage vs. Jargon:**
  - Good Usage: Words that fill a real need, are vivid, and express clear meaning (e.g., "dropout," "stonewall," "launder").
  - Bad Usage (Jargon): Pompous verbs ("prioritize," "definitize"), nouns turned into verbs ("impact" as a verb), or fuzzy nouns ("facilitation").

## III. Structural Methods

### 1. Unity

Unity is the anchor of good writing. It satisfies the reader's subconscious need for order. Before starting, ask:

- **Unity of Pronoun:** Am I writing in the first person (participant) or third person (observer)?
- **Unity of Tense:** Past or present? (Stick to one principally).
- **Unity of Mood:** Casual? Formal? Ironic? Judgmental? (Don't mix tones).
- **The Most Important Question:** "What **one point** do I want to make?"
  - _Guideline:_ Every successful piece of nonfiction should leave the reader with one provocative thought. Not two, not five. Just one.

### 2. The Lead (The Hook)

- **Function:** The lead must capture the reader immediately and force them to keep reading.
- **Techniques:** Freshness, novelty, paradox, humor, surprise, an unusual idea, or an interesting fact.
- **Work:** It must tell the reader _why_ the piece was written and _why_ they ought to read it.
- **Pacing:** Every paragraph should amplify the one preceding it. The last sentence of each paragraph should act as a springboard to the next (the "snapper").

### 3. The Ending

- **Importance:** Knowing when to stop is as important as knowing where to start.
- **Avoid:** The summary ending ("In sum, it can be noted..."). Don't repeat what you have already said.
- **The Ideal Ending:** It should take the reader slightly by surprise and yet seem exactly right.
  - _Technique:_ A quotation that is funny, final, or adds an unexpected closing detail.
  - _Technique:_ Full circle—echoing a note sounded at the beginning.

## IV. Bits & Pieces (Tactical Rules)

### 1. Verbs

- **Active vs. Passive:** Use active verbs. "Joe saw him" is strong. "He was seen by Joe" is weak.
- **Precision:** Don't use general verbs with appended prepositions ("start up," "launch"). Use precise verbs ("resign," "retire," "fire").

### 2. Adverbs

- **The Rule:** Most adverbs are unnecessary.
- **Redundancy:** Do not qualify a strong verb with a redundant adverb.
  - _Bad:_ "The radio blared loudly" ("Blare" implies loud).
  - _Bad:_ "Clenched his teeth tightly" (You cannot clench loosely).

### 3. Adjectives

- **The Rule:** Most adjectives are unnecessary.
- **Concept:** Don't describe what is already in the noun (e.g., "yellow daffodils," "brownish dirt").
- **Usage:** Only use adjectives to do work the noun alone cannot do (e.g., "garish daffodils").

### 4. Qualifiers (The Leaks)

- **Eliminate:** "A bit," "a little," "sort of," "kind of," "rather," "quite," "very," "pretty much," "in a sense."
- **Effect:** These dilute style and persuasiveness. Don't be "kind of bold." Be bold.

### 5. Punctuation

- **The Period:** Most writers don't reach it soon enough. Break long sentences into two. Short sentences predominate in good writing.
- **The Exclamation Point:** Avoid it. It creates a "gushy" aura. Do not use it to signal a joke or irony; let the humor stand on its own.
- **The Semicolon:** Use sparingly; it slows momentum to a Victorian pace.
- **The Dash:** An invaluable tool. It pushes the sentence forward or sets apart a parenthetical thought with more emphasis than commas.

### 6. Concept Nouns & Creeping Nounism

- **Avoid:** Abstract nouns like "reaction," "cynicism," "response," "hostility" used as subjects.
  - _Bad:_ "The current campus hostility is a symptom..."
  - _Good:_ "It's easy to see how angry the students are."
- **Avoid:** Stringing nouns together (e.g., "Communication facilitation skills development intervention").

### 7. Rewriting

- **Essence:** Rewriting is the essence of writing well.
- **Process:** It is not just writing a new draft; it is reshaping, tightening, and refining.
- **Technique:** Read the text aloud. The ear will catch clumsy rhythms that the eye missed.
- **The Delete Key:** Learn to love the delete key. "I don't like to write... I love to rewrite."

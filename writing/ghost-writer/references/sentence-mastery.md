# Sentence Mastery

Principles for crafting sentences that create rhythm, clarity, and voice.

*Inspired by Verlyn Klinkenborg's "Several Short Sentences About Writing"*

## Purpose

Voice lives at the sentence level. The DNA document captures sentence patterns; this guide helps you craft sentences that embody those patterns with intention.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Every Sentence Should Be Able to Stand Alone

A sentence should make sense on its own. It should be complete. It shouldn't rely on the sentences around it to prop it up.

Test: Cover the sentences before and after. Does this sentence still work?

### 2. Short Sentences Are Not Simple Sentences

Brevity is not the same as simplicity. A short sentence can carry tremendous weight:

> "She left."

These two words might be the climax of a story.

### 3. Long Sentences Must Earn Their Length

If a sentence is long, every word must justify its presence. Long sentences without structural integrity collapse under their own weight.

### 4. Meaning Comes from Structure, Not Just Words

The same words in different arrangements create different meanings:

> "Only she loved him."
> "She only loved him."
> "She loved only him."

Each says something different.

### 5. The End of the Sentence Carries the Most Weight

Place your most important word at the end:

> Weak: "There is something essential I need to tell you about trust."
> Strong: "I need to tell you something essential about trust."
> Stronger: "I need to tell you something essential: trust."

## Sentence Architecture

### The Simple Sentence

Subject + Verb (+ Object)

> "The code failed."
> "She wrote the book."
> "Time passed."

Power: Directness, clarity, punch.

### The Compound Sentence

Two independent clauses joined by a conjunction.

> "The code failed, and we started over."
> "She wrote the book, but no one published it."

Power: Relationship between equal ideas.

### The Complex Sentence

Independent clause + dependent clause.

> "When the code failed, we started over."
> "She wrote the book after years of trying."

Power: Shows causation, time, condition.

### The Loose Sentence

Main point first, then modifying elements.

> "The sun set, casting long shadows, turning the sky orange."

Power: Extension, accumulation, building.

### The Periodic Sentence

Modifying elements first, main point at the end.

> "After three years of work, after countless revisions, after believing it would never happen—the book was done."

Power: Suspense, emphasis, climax.

---

## Rhythm and Variation

### The Rhythm of Length

Varying sentence length creates rhythm:

> "The meeting started at 9. By noon, we had covered three items on a twenty-item agenda. The fourth item took the rest of the day. It was important."

Pattern: Short → Medium → Medium → Short

The short sentence at the end lands with emphasis.

### The Rhythm of Structure

Varying sentence structure creates flow:

> "She arrived early. Before anyone else was awake, she had already started working. The plan was simple: finish before the deadline."

Pattern: Simple → Complex → Simple with colon

### The Power of Three

Three beats often feel complete:

> "I came. I saw. I conquered."

But: Don't overuse. The rule of three becomes mechanical.

### The Power of Two

Two beats create contrast or continuation:

> "It was difficult. It was necessary."

### The Power of One

Single-sentence paragraphs create emphasis:

> [Previous paragraph]
>
> "Everything changed."
>
> [Next paragraph]

## Sentence Openings

### Avoid Repeated Openings

Five sentences starting with "The" or "I" in a row creates monotony.

### Vary Your Openings

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Subject | "The project succeeded." |
| Time | "Eventually, the project succeeded." |
| Prepositional | "Against all odds, the project succeeded." |
| Gerund | "Working through the night, we succeeded." |
| Infinitive | "To succeed, we worked through the night." |
| Transitional | "However, the project still failed." |
| Inverted | "Never had we worked so hard." |

### Opening Words to Watch

Be conscious of which words you start with:
- "It" — often leads to expletive construction ("It is important...")
- "There" — often weak ("There are many reasons...")
- "The" — fine but monotonous if overused
- "This" — needs clear reference

---

## Sentence Endings

### The Final Word Matters

The last word echoes. Choose it deliberately.

> Weak: "This was an important point I needed to make."
> Strong: "This was a point I needed to make—an important one."
> Stronger: "I needed to make this point. It was important."

### Avoid Trailing Off

Sentences that fade away lose power:

> Weak: "It was a problem, in a way."
> Strong: "It was a problem."

### The Landing

A good sentence lands. The reader knows it's over. There's a sense of completion.

---

## The Clause

### Understanding Clauses

A clause is a group of words with a subject and a verb.

**Independent clause:** Can stand alone as a sentence.
**Dependent clause:** Cannot stand alone; depends on another clause.

### Clause Management

Too many dependent clauses create confusion:

> Confusing: "When the project started, because we needed funding, although the team was small, we submitted the proposal."

Untangle:

> Clear: "The project was starting. We needed funding. Though the team was small, we submitted the proposal."

### Relative Clauses

"Who," "which," "that" introduce relative clauses. Use them cleanly:

> Muddled: "The report that the team that was hired last month wrote, which was the one about sales, was late."

> Clear: "The sales report was late. The team hired last month wrote it."

---

## Punctuation as Structure

### The Period

The period is definitive. It ends. It creates silence. The next sentence begins fresh.

Short sentences with periods create rhythm:
> "We tried. We failed. We tried again."

### The Comma

The comma creates pause, but continues movement. It joins elements. It separates items. It sets off asides.

Watch for: comma splices (incorrectly joining independent clauses).

### The Semicolon

The semicolon joins related independent clauses; it signals continuation while creating a stronger pause than a comma.

Use when: ideas are closely related but deserve full clause structure.

### The Colon

The colon announces: what follows explains or specifies what came before.

> "There was one problem: the budget."

### The Em-Dash

The em-dash interrupts—dramatically—or pivots suddenly.

Use for: asides, pivots, emphasis.
Watch for: overuse (see anti-ai-patterns).

### The Parentheses

Parentheses contain supplementary information (which could be removed without losing the main point).

Use sparingly; they can make prose feel cluttered.

## Reading Your Sentences

### Read Aloud

Reading aloud reveals:
- Where you stumble (structural problem)
- Where you run out of breath (too long)
- Where rhythm breaks (needs variation)

### Read One at a Time

Cover the surrounding text. Read only one sentence. Does it:
- Make sense?
- Sound complete?
- Have weight?

### Read Backwards

Read the piece sentence by sentence, from end to beginning. This breaks the flow and lets you evaluate each sentence independently.

---

## Common Sentence Problems

### 1. The Run-On

Two or more independent clauses without proper punctuation:

> Wrong: "The meeting ended we went home."
> Right: "The meeting ended. We went home."

### 2. The Fragment

A clause treated as a sentence when it's incomplete:

> Fragment: "Because we needed to finish."
> Complete: "We stayed late because we needed to finish."

Note: Fragments can be stylistically effective. "Absolutely." But use intentionally.

### 3. The Comma Splice

Joining independent clauses with just a comma:

> Splice: "The code broke, we fixed it."
> Fixed: "The code broke. We fixed it."
> Or: "The code broke, so we fixed it."
> Or: "The code broke; we fixed it."

### 4. The Monotone

Every sentence the same length, same structure:

> "The project started in January. The team had five members. The budget was limited. The deadline was tight. The results were good."

Vary the rhythm.

### 5. The Overstuffed

Too much crammed into one sentence:

> "When the project started, which was in January of last year, the team, consisting of five members from three departments, with a limited budget of only $50,000 for the full fiscal year, faced a tight deadline that would require..."

Break it up.

## DNA Calibration for Sentences

### Match the Documented Rhythm

If DNA shows:
- Short sentences: Keep average low, resist extending
- Long sentences: Allow more complexity
- Varied: Consciously alternate

### Match the Documented Structure

If DNA shows:
- Simple structures: Fewer clauses, more periods
- Complex structures: More clauses, semicolons appropriate
- Lists and parallel structures: Use them

### Match the Documented Openings

If DNA shows patterns:
- Starts with action verbs: Do that
- Starts with "I" frequently: Do that
- Rarely starts with "The": Avoid it

# Voice Consumption Guide

How to read, internalize, and apply a Voice DNA Document.

---

## Purpose

This guide explains how to consume a Voice DNA Document effectively so you can produce drafts that authentically match the writer's voice. The DNA document is your source of truth for what makes this writer distinctive.

---

## Document Structure Overview

A Voice DNA Document contains these sections, in order of operational importance:

### Priority 1: Quick Reference

The 30-second snapshot. Contains:
- **Core Temperature** — The emotional register (warm, cool, enthusiastic, measured)
- **Sentence Signature** — The defining rhythm pattern
- **Distinctive Moves** — 2-3 most recognizable patterns
- **Never Does** — Key anti-patterns

**Use this for:** Quick orientation before drafting, mid-draft course correction, quick pattern checks.

### Priority 2: Ghost Writer Briefing

The actionable instructions section. Contains:
- **Voice Essence** — 2-3 sentence north star
- **Do This** — Specific actions to take
- **Don't Do This** — Specific things to avoid
- **When Uncertain** — Decision rules for ambiguous situations
- **Sentence-Level Guidance** — Metrics and patterns for sentences
- **Structural Guidance** — Paragraph, transition, opening, closing patterns

**Use this for:** Primary drafting guidance, decision-making, pattern application.

### Priority 3: Anti-Patterns

What to actively avoid. Contains:
- **Pattern to Avoid** — Specific patterns this writer doesn't use
- **Why It's Wrong** — Reasoning for why it doesn't fit
- **AI Patterns to Suppress** — Checklist of common AI tells to avoid

**Use this for:** Quality control, self-editing, pattern suppression.

### Priority 4: Exemplar Passages

Annotated quotes that demonstrate voice in action. Contains:
- Actual excerpts from the writer's work
- Pattern annotations explaining what each demonstrates

**Use this for:** Voice calibration, seeing patterns in context, understanding how elements combine.

### Priority 5: Voice Profile

Detailed dimension-by-dimension analysis. Contains:
- Sentence Level (rhythm, length, structure)
- Punctuation Personality (em-dashes, semicolons, comma density)
- Paragraph & Structure (paragraph length, transitions)
- Word Choice & Vocabulary (Anglo-Saxon vs. Latinate, favorites, avoided)
- Tone & Attitude (temperature, formality, confidence)
- Reader Relationship (first/second person, authority stance)
- Opening & Closing Moves
- Humor Approach
- Signature Elements

Each dimension has:
- Status (Not Assessed / Emerging / Developed / Strong)
- Analysis and patterns
- Examples from their writing

**Use this for:** Deep understanding, nuance, handling specific challenges.

### Priority 6: Profile Metadata

Information about the document itself:
- **Readiness Level** — Minimum Viable / Solid / Strong
- **Confidence Assessment** — Per-dimension confidence ratings
- **Sample Base** — What samples were analyzed
- **Dimensions Needing Depth** — Gaps to be aware of
- **Open Questions** — Unresolved areas

**Use this for:** Confidence calibration, knowing where to be conservative.

### Priority 7: Register-Specific Notes

Context for the specific writing mode:
- Fiction-specific patterns (narrative distance, dialogue style)
- Non-fiction patterns (argument style, evidence handling)
- Blog/casual patterns (hooks, personal disclosure)

**Use this for:** Register-appropriate choices.

## Reading Process

### Step 1: Initial Scan (30 seconds)

Read in this order:
1. **Profile Metadata: Readiness Level** — Know your confidence baseline
2. **Quick Reference** — Get the core fingerprint
3. **Voice Essence** (in Ghost Writer Briefing) — Internalize the north star

After this, you should be able to state in one sentence what makes this writer's voice distinctive.

### Step 2: Operational Internalization (2-3 minutes)

Read in full:
1. **Ghost Writer Briefing** — All subsections
2. **Anti-Patterns** — Both specific and AI patterns

After this, you should know:
- What to actively do
- What to actively avoid
- How to handle uncertainty

### Step 3: Depth Reading (as needed)

Read based on the task:
1. **Exemplar Passages** — To hear the voice in action
2. **Voice Profile dimensions** — For specific guidance

Focus on dimensions with "Strong" or "Developed" status. Be more conservative with "Emerging" or "Not Assessed" dimensions.

### Step 4: Context Check

Review:
1. **Register-Specific Notes** — If relevant to the task
2. **Dimensions Needing Depth** — Know where the gaps are
3. **Open Questions** — Unresolved areas to handle carefully

## Building a Mental Model

Before drafting, you should have internalized:

### The Voice Fingerprint

Ask yourself: "If I read 100 unlabeled pieces of writing, what would let me identify this writer's work?"

The answer should come from:
- Sentence Signature (rhythm, length patterns)
- 2-3 Distinctive Moves
- Emotional Temperature
- Key anti-patterns (what they'd never do)

### The Decision Framework

When you face a choice during drafting, you should know:
1. What the DNA document explicitly says (Do This / Don't Do This)
2. What the "When Uncertain" rules prescribe
3. What the Exemplar Passages suggest
4. What would feel "off" based on anti-patterns

### The Confidence Map

Know which dimensions you can apply confidently vs. where you're inferring:

| Dimension | Status | Your Confidence |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| High status + detailed | Strong → apply with confidence |
| Developed status | Moderate → apply, note in draft notes |
| Emerging status | Low → be conservative, flag uncertainty |
| Not Assessed | Minimal → use craft principles, flag heavily |

## Dimension-by-Dimension Application

### Sentence Level

**What to extract:**
- Average length range
- Variation pattern (consistent vs. unpredictable)
- Internal structure preferences (simple vs. complex)
- Opening word tendencies
- Emphasis placement (front-loaded vs. end-weighted)

**How to apply:**
- Match the rhythm, not just the length
- Vary sentences as they do (or don't)
- Place emphasis where they would

### Punctuation Personality

**What to extract:**
- Em-dash frequency and purpose
- Semicolon presence/absence
- Parenthetical style
- Comma density (tight vs. flowing)
- Exclamation point philosophy

**How to apply:**
- Mirror their punctuation choices closely
- Punctuation is often deeply personal—don't deviate
- If they never use semicolons, neither should you

### Word Choice & Vocabulary

**What to extract:**
- Vocabulary level (simple vs. complex)
- Anglo-Saxon vs. Latinate preferences
- Favorite words and phrases to use
- Avoided words and phrases to never use
- Contraction usage
- Jargon handling

**How to apply:**
- Use their favorite words when appropriate
- Actively avoid their avoided words
- Match their contraction pattern
- Mirror their vocabulary level precisely

### Tone & Attitude

**What to extract:**
- Emotional temperature (warm, cool, neutral)
- Formality level
- Confidence style (direct vs. hedged)
- Authority stance

**How to apply:**
- This is the "feel" of the writing
- A warm writer should feel warm; a cool writer should feel cool
- Don't accidentally shift formality

### Reader Relationship

**What to extract:**
- First person presence ("I" frequency)
- Second person usage ("you" direct address)
- Reader assumptions (expertise level)
- Authority stance (expert, guide, fellow traveler)

**How to apply:**
- Match their "I" frequency closely
- Use "you" as they do (or don't)
- Assume the same reader they assume
- Take the same authority stance

### Opening & Closing Moves

**What to extract:**
- How they typically begin pieces
- How they typically end pieces
- Opening examples
- Closing examples

**How to apply:**
- Start pieces as they would
- End pieces as they would
- Consider opening/closing resonance (do they echo?)

### Humor Approach

**What to extract:**
- Humor present? (yes/no/occasionally)
- Type (dry wit, self-deprecation, wordplay, etc.)
- Placement (woven throughout, strategic moments, asides)

**How to apply:**
- Be conservative—humor is personal and hard to match
- Flag opportunities rather than attempting
- If attempting, match type and placement

### Signature Elements

**What to extract:**
- Distinctive moves (things only they do)
- Pet phrases
- Characteristic tics

**How to apply:**
- These are the most personal patterns
- Use them—they're what makes the writing recognizably theirs
- But don't overuse (note their frequency)

## Handling Gaps

When the DNA document doesn't have strong guidance for a dimension:

### If Status is "Emerging" or "Not Assessed"

1. Check "When Uncertain" rules first
2. Look at Exemplar Passages for implicit patterns
3. Default to craft principles (from other reference docs)
4. Be conservative—avoid risky choices
5. Note in draft notes that you inferred

### If Dimension Is Missing Entirely

1. Don't guess wildly
2. Use general craft principles
3. Flag heavily in draft notes
4. Suggest this dimension for future discovery

### If Patterns Conflict

1. Check "When Uncertain" rules
2. Apply hierarchy: specific instructions > general tendencies
3. If still unclear, pick one and explain reasoning
4. Note the conflict in draft notes

---

## Freshness and Evolution

### Check Document Age

- If created within 3 months: Assume current
- If 3-6 months old: Probably fine, minor drift possible
- If 6+ months old: Flag potential evolution, proceed with awareness
- If 12+ months old: Recommend refresh session

### Watch for Evolution Signals

During intake, listen for:
- "My writing has changed since then"
- "I don't write like that anymore"
- "I've been experimenting with..."

If evolution is indicated, note it and adjust confidence.

---

## Readiness Level Impact

### Minimum Viable Profile (~60-70% accuracy)

- Use what's there
- Be conservative in gaps
- Lean on craft principles
- Flag more uncertainty
- Suggest discovery session

### Solid Profile (~75-85% accuracy)

- Apply documented patterns confidently
- Infer reasonably from Exemplar Passages
- Flag genuine ambiguities
- Trust the Ghost Writer Briefing

### Strong Profile (~85-90% accuracy)

- High confidence application
- Trust the comprehensive documentation
- Make bolder choices within documented patterns
- Output should be recognizably "them"

## Pre-Drafting Checklist

Before you begin drafting, confirm you know:

- [ ] The voice essence (one-sentence summary)
- [ ] 3-5 key patterns to apply
- [ ] 3-5 anti-patterns to avoid
- [ ] The emotional temperature
- [ ] The "When Uncertain" rules
- [ ] The readiness level (your confidence baseline)
- [ ] The gaps (where to be conservative)

If you can't answer these, re-read the document.

## Quick Reference During Drafting

When drafting and you need a quick check:

1. **"Does this sentence feel right?"** → Check Sentence Signature, Exemplar Passages
2. **"Would they use this word?"** → Check Word Choice, Avoided Words
3. **"Is this too formal/casual?"** → Check Tone & Attitude
4. **"How would they start/end this?"** → Check Opening & Closing Moves
5. **"Is this an AI tell?"** → Check Anti-Patterns, AI Patterns to Suppress

---

## Summary

The Voice DNA Document is your guide, not your constraint. Use it to:

1. **Understand** what makes this writer distinctive
2. **Apply** documented patterns with confidence
3. **Avoid** documented anti-patterns strictly
4. **Infer** reasonably where documentation is thin
5. **Flag** where you're uncertain

The goal is 80% accuracy—writing that feels like them. The human adds the final 20%.

# Blog Writing Guide

Conventions and techniques for blog posts and digital content.

---

## Purpose

Blog posts have distinct conventions shaped by how people read online. This guide covers format-specific considerations while maintaining the writer's authentic voice.

**Priority:** The DNA document defines voice. This guide provides format-aware techniques within that voice.

## How People Read Blogs

### Online Reading Behavior

**Key patterns:**
- Scan first, read later (if at all)
- F-pattern eye tracking (top, left side, occasional horizontal scans)
- Decide within 3-5 seconds whether to continue
- Read on phones (small screens, interruption-prone)
- Jump to sections of interest
- Skim headings and bold text

### Implications for Writing

- Hook must land immediately
- Content must be scannable
- Value must be front-loaded
- Paragraphs must be short
- Structure must be visible

---

## Structure Conventions

### The Hook Zone

The first 100 words decide whether readers stay.

**Must accomplish:**
- Signal what the piece is about
- Establish why they should care
- Promise value worth their time
- Sound like a human (not AI)

**Techniques:**
- Lead with the insight, not the setup
- Start with action, conflict, or surprise
- Avoid throat-clearing ("In today's world...")

### Headings

**Use headings to:**
- Break content into scannable sections
- Signal what each section covers
- Let readers jump to what interests them
- Create visual rhythm

**Heading guidelines:**
- Use sentence case (not Title Case)
- Be descriptive, not clever
- Front-load key words
- Keep under 8 words

### Paragraphs

**Online paragraph guidelines:**
- 2-4 sentences typical
- Single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis
- One idea per paragraph
- Break on transitions

**Why shorter paragraphs:**
- Easier to scan
- More white space
- Less intimidating
- Better mobile experience

### Lists

**When to use lists:**
- Presenting options
- Summarizing steps
- Highlighting key points
- Improving scannability

**List guidelines:**
- Lead-in sentence before the list
- Parallel structure for items
- 3-7 items optimal
- Avoid nested lists

## Opening Strategies for Blogs

### Strong Blog Openings

**Problem-solution hook:**
> "Your git history is a mess. Here's how to fix it in ten minutes."

**Bold claim:**
> "Most career advice is wrong. Here's what actually works."

**Personal hook:**
> "Last week, I made a mistake that cost me three hours. Here's what I learned."

**Counter-intuitive:**
> "I stopped setting goals. My productivity doubled."

### Weak Blog Openings

**Avoid:**
- "In this post, I will discuss..."
- "Have you ever wondered about..."
- "Let me tell you about..."
- "Today we're going to talk about..."

## Body Structure

### The Inverted Pyramid

Most important information first.

```
Key insight / Main point
↓
Supporting arguments
↓
Details and examples
↓
Background / Context
```

Readers who leave early still get the main point.

### The Problem-Solution Arc

```
1. State the problem (relatable)
2. Why it matters (stakes)
3. Common approaches (and why they fail)
4. The solution (your insight)
5. How to implement (actionable)
6. Results to expect (motivation)
```

### The Listicle Structure

```
1. Hook + promise of value
2. Brief context
3. Item 1 (with explanation)
4. Item 2 (with explanation)
...
N. Summary or call to action
```

---

## Formatting for Scanability

### Bold Text

**Use for:**
- Key terms on first use
- Words readers might scan for
- Essential points in paragraphs

**Don't:**
- Bold entire sentences
- Bold too much (loses meaning)
- Bold for emphasis in running prose

### Subheadings

Insert every 200-400 words. Ask: "If someone only read the headings, would they get the gist?"

### Pull Quotes / Callouts

For key insights worth highlighting:

> "The most productive thing you can do is often nothing at all."

### Code Blocks (Technical Blogs)

```
Format code clearly
Use syntax highlighting
Keep examples minimal
```

---

## Closings for Blogs

### Effective Blog Closings

**Call to action:**
> "Try this technique today. Let me know how it goes."

**Question:**
> "What's your approach? I'd love to hear in the comments."

**Forward-looking:**
> "Next week, I'll cover the advanced version of this."

**The kicker:**
> "The experts were wrong. Now you know."

### Avoid

- "In conclusion..."
- "That's all for today!"
- Trailing off without resolution
- Abrupt endings without landing

---

## Length Guidelines

### Word Count by Type

| Type | Typical Length |
|------|----------------|
| Quick tip | 300-500 words |
| Standard post | 800-1,500 words |
| Deep dive | 2,000-3,000 words |
| Comprehensive guide | 3,000-5,000 words |

### Length Considerations

**Shorter when:**
- Single focused insight
- Busy audience
- Mobile-first readers

**Longer when:**
- Comprehensive coverage needed
- SEO matters (depth signals)
- Topic deserves exploration

**The test:**
Is every word earning its place? Cut until no more can be cut.

## Voice Considerations for Blogs

### Matching DNA to Format

The DNA document defines voice. Apply it to blog conventions:

**If DNA shows formal voice:**
- Keep formality but tighten paragraphs
- Use headings (even if writer doesn't typically)
- Maintain vocabulary but improve scannability

**If DNA shows casual voice:**
- Lean into conversational hooks
- Use contractions, direct address
- Short paragraphs feel natural

**If DNA shows analytical voice:**
- Front-load conclusions
- Evidence remains, but more concise
- Headings help reader navigate logic

### Personalness Level

Check DNA for:
- First-person usage (how much "I")
- Personal disclosure level
- Anecdote usage

Apply that level to the blog format. A personal writer's blog feels personal. An analytical writer's blog feels analytical but well-structured.

---

## Common Blog Mistakes

### 1. Burying the Lede

The main point should come early. If readers leave after paragraph 2, they should still know the key insight.

### 2. Wall of Text

No headings, no breaks, no white space. Unreadable on mobile.

### 3. Clickbait That Doesn't Deliver

Promise must match delivery. Overpromising erodes trust.

### 4. All Setup, No Payoff

Too much context before getting to the point.

### 5. No Clear Takeaway

Reader finishes wondering, "What was the point?"

### 6. AI-Sounding Prose

See `anti-ai-patterns.md`. Blogs especially need to feel human.

## Technical Considerations

### Links

- Link relevant resources
- Use descriptive anchor text
- Don't over-link (distracting)
- Open external links in new tabs (if appropriate)

### Images

- Break up long text
- Support points visually
- Include alt text
- Compress for speed

### Mobile Optimization

- Test how it looks on phone
- Avoid wide tables
- Keep images full-width
- Ensure tap targets are large enough

This creates meaningful difference between drafts.

## Opening Weaknesses to Avoid

**Throat-clearing:**
> "In today's fast-paced world..."
> "When it comes to X..."
> "Many people believe..."

**Meta-commentary:**
> "In this article, I will..."
> "Let me tell you about..."

**Dictionary definition:**
> "Webster's defines success as..."

**Obvious statements:**
> "Communication is important."
> "Technology has changed everything."

**Unearned drama:**
> "What happened next changed everything." (without context)

---

## Quick Selection Guide

**Need to grab fast?** → Bold Statement, Statistic, The Pivot

**Building relationship?** → Anecdote, Confession, Direct Address

**Telling a story?** → In Media Res, Scene Setting, Dialogue

**Making an argument?** → Thesis First, Problem Statement, Contradiction

## Opening/Closing Resonance

Consider how the opening might connect to the closing:

| Opening | Possible Closing Echo |
|---------|----------------------|
| Anecdote | Return to the scene, resolution |
| Question | Answer revealed, question reframed |
| Bold Statement | Statement validated, nuanced, or subverted |
| Imagery | Same image, transformed |
| Time Shift | Full circle, or projection forward |

Creating opening/closing resonance makes pieces feel complete. Note this in draft notes when you use it.

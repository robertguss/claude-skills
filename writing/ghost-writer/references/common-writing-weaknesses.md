# Common Writing Weaknesses

Patterns that weaken prose. Watch for these during drafting and self-editing.

---

## Purpose

Beyond AI patterns (covered in `anti-ai-patterns.md`), these are general weaknesses that make prose less effective. Avoiding these improves output quality even when they don't violate the writer's specific voice.

**Note:** If the DNA document shows the writer uses these patterns intentionally, follow the DNA.

## Weakness Categories

### 1. Passive Voice Overuse

**What It Is:**
The subject receives the action rather than performing it.

**Examples:**

| Passive | Active |
|---------|--------|
| The book was read by the students | The students read the book |
| Mistakes were made | We made mistakes |
| The decision was reached | We reached a decision |
| It was determined that | We determined |
| The data is shown in Figure 1 | Figure 1 shows the data |

**Why It's Weak:**
- Obscures who is acting
- Adds words
- Reduces directness
- Can feel evasive ("mistakes were made")

**When Passive Is Fine:**
- Actor unknown: "The building was constructed in 1885"
- Actor unimportant: "The samples were collected over three months"
- Deliberate emphasis on recipient: "Kennedy was assassinated"

**Fix:**
Identify the actor. Make them the subject. Use active verb.

---

### 2. Nominalization

**What It Is:**
Turning verbs into nouns, often adding wordiness.

**Examples:**

| Nominalized | Verbal |
|-------------|--------|
| made a decision | decided |
| conducted an investigation | investigated |
| gave a presentation | presented |
| reached an agreement | agreed |
| made an improvement | improved |
| provided an explanation | explained |
| performed an analysis | analyzed |
| achieved a reduction | reduced |

**Why It's Weak:**
- Adds words
- Buries the action
- Creates abstract, bureaucratic tone
- Often requires weak verbs (made, gave, performed)

**Detection:**
Watch for nouns ending in -tion, -ment, -ance, -ence preceded by weak verbs.

**Fix:**
Find the buried verb. Use it directly.

---

### 3. Hedge Words and Qualifiers

**What They Are:**
Words that soften statements, reduce commitment.

**Common Hedge Words:**
- very
- really
- quite
- somewhat
- rather
- fairly
- relatively
- basically
- essentially
- generally
- usually
- often
- tends to
- seems to
- appears to
- in my opinion
- I think
- I feel
- I believe
- sort of
- kind of

**Examples:**

| Hedged | Direct |
|--------|--------|
| It seems to be very important | It's important |
| I think this is basically the issue | This is the issue |
| The results were quite significant | The results were significant |
| It's sort of a problem | It's a problem |
| She tends to be rather late | She's often late |

**Why They're Weak:**
- Undermine confidence
- Add words without meaning
- Make writer seem uncertain
- Dilute impact

**When Hedging Is Appropriate:**
- Genuine uncertainty: "The data suggests..." (when you can't prove)
- Appropriate caution: "In some cases..."
- DNA document shows hedging is part of voice

**Fix:**
Cut the hedge. Make the claim. If you can't make it confidently, reconsider whether to make it.

### 4. Throat-Clearing Openings

**What They Are:**
Introductory phrases that delay the point.

**Examples:**
- "In order to understand X, we must first consider..."
- "When it comes to X, there are many things to say..."
- "It goes without saying that..."
- "As we all know..."
- "The fact of the matter is..."
- "In today's world..."
- "Throughout history..."
- "Many people believe..."
- "It is often said that..."
- "In this article/essay/piece..."

**Why They're Weak:**
- Delay the point
- State the obvious
- Sound generic
- Waste reader's time

**Fix:**
Delete the throat-clearing. Start with the actual point.

> Before: "In order to understand modern software development, we must first consider the history of programming."
> After: "Modern software development has roots in the earliest programming languages."

Or even better: Start with something specific and interesting.

### 5. Weak Verbs

**What They Are:**
Verbs that don't carry meaning, often requiring adverbs.

**Weak Verbs:**
- is/was/were/be
- has/have/had
- get/got
- do/did
- make/made
- go/went

**Examples:**

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|

| make a change | change / alter / revise |
| had an impact | affected / influenced / shaped |

**Why They're Weak:**
- Don't paint pictures
- Require adverbs to do the work
- Feel generic

**Fix:**
Find a verb that contains the adverb's meaning.

---

### 6. Adverb Dependency

**What It Is:**
Relying on adverbs to do work the verb should do.

**Examples:**

| Adverb-Dependent | Strong Verb |
|------------------|-------------|
| ran quickly | sprinted / dashed |
| talked quietly | whispered / murmured |
| fell suddenly | plummeted / dropped |
| ate quickly | devoured / wolfed |
| worked hard | labored / toiled |
| very big | enormous / massive |
| really tired | exhausted |

**Why It's Weak:**
- Two words doing one word's job
- Shows lazy word choice
- Reduces impact

**Fix:**
Find the precise verb. Cut the adverb.

### 7. Redundancy

**What It Is:**
Saying the same thing twice.

**Examples:**

| Redundant | Clean |
|-----------|-------|
| past history | history |
| future plans | plans |
| true fact | fact |
| end result | result |
| free gift | gift |
| completely unanimous | unanimous |
| advance planning | planning |
| new innovation | innovation |
| basic fundamentals | fundamentals |
| final outcome | outcome |
| join together | join |
| repeat again | repeat |
| postpone until later | postpone |
| surrounded on all sides | surrounded |

**Why It's Weak:**
- Wastes words
- Shows careless thinking
- Undermines trust in precision

**Fix:**
Cut the redundant word.

---

### 8. Expletive Constructions

**What They Are:**
Sentences starting with "It is," "There is," or "There are" when these words don't refer to anything specific.

**Examples:**

| Expletive | Direct |
|-----------|--------|
| There are many people who believe | Many people believe |
| It is important that we consider | We should consider |
| There is a need for improvement | Improvement is needed / We need to improve |
| It was decided that | We decided |
| There exists a possibility | A possibility exists / X might happen |

**Why They're Weak:**
- Delay the true subject
- Add words
- Create passive feel

**Fix:**
Find the real subject. Start with it.

---

### 9. Prepositional Pile-Up

**What It Is:**
Chains of prepositional phrases that clutter sentences.

**Example:**
> "The book on the table in the corner of the room by the window near the door was old."

**Why It's Weak:**
- Hard to parse
- Buries main elements
- Creates choppy rhythm

**Fix:**
- Break into multiple sentences
- Restructure to reduce prepositions
- Choose more specific nouns

> "The old book sat on the corner table by the window."

---

### 10. Mixed Metaphors

**What They Are:**
Combining incompatible figurative images.

**Examples:**
- "We need to get all our ducks on the same page"
- "He's burning the midnight oil at both ends"
- "That's a tough road to swallow"
- "Let's nip this in the bud before it snowballs"

**Why They're Weak:**
- Create absurd mental images
- Distract from meaning
- Undermine credibility

**Fix:**
- Choose one metaphor
- Follow it consistently
- Or drop metaphors entirely

---

### 11. Clichés

**What They Are:**
Overused expressions that have lost impact.

**Examples:**
- at the end of the day
- think outside the box
- it is what it is
- in this day and age
- go the extra mile
- take it to the next level
- game-changer
- paradigm shift
- low-hanging fruit
- move the needle
- circle back
- deep dive

**Why They're Weak:**
- Generic
- Don't paint fresh pictures
- Suggest lazy thinking

**Fix:**
- Say what you mean directly
- Find a fresh expression
- Use specific details instead

---

### 12. Unclear Pronoun Reference

**What It Is:**
Pronouns with ambiguous antecedents.

**Example:**
> "When John met Bob, he said he was tired."
(Who said? Who was tired?)

**Why It's Weak:**
- Confuses readers
- Forces re-reading
- Breaks flow

**Fix:**
- Use the noun instead of pronoun
- Restructure to clarify

> "When John met Bob, John said Bob looked tired."

## Quick Detection List

During self-editing, scan for:

- [ ] Passive constructions (was/were + past participle)
- [ ] Nominalizations (-tion, -ment after weak verbs)
- [ ] Hedge words (very, really, somewhat, tends to)
- [ ] Throat-clearing openers (In order to, When it comes to)
- [ ] Weak verb + adverb combos
- [ ] Redundancies (past history, true fact)
- [ ] "It is" and "There are" starters
- [ ] Preposition chains
- [ ] Mixed metaphors
- [ ] Clichés
- [ ] Unclear pronoun references

---

## Priority Fixes

**High priority (fix always):**
- Unclear pronoun reference
- Mixed metaphors
- Passive voice obscuring responsibility

**Medium priority (fix usually):**
- Nominalizations
- Hedge words
- Weak verbs + adverbs
- Expletive constructions
- Redundancy

**Low priority (fix if easy):**
- Prepositional pile-up
- Clichés (unless DNA shows writer avoids them)

**Context-dependent:**
- Throat-clearing (some writers warm up deliberately)
- Passive voice (depends on purpose)

---

## DNA Override

All of these are default guidelines. If the DNA document shows:
- Writer loves adverbs → use them
- Writer hedges deliberately → hedge
- Writer uses clichés ironically → use them
- Writer prefers passive voice → follow their preference

Voice fidelity > generic rules.

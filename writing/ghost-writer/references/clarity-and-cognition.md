# Clarity and Cognition

Principles for writing that respects how readers think.

*Inspired by Steven Pinker's "The Sense of Style"*

## Purpose

Clear writing isn't about simple words—it's about alignment with how minds process information. This guide covers cognitive principles that make prose clearer and more effective.

## The Curse of Knowledge

### What It Is

The curse of knowledge is the difficulty of imagining what it's like not to know something you know.

Experts forget what it was like to learn. They skip steps. They use shorthand. They assume context that readers don't have.

### Why It Matters

Most unclear writing isn't caused by complex topics. It's caused by writers who can't see their subject from the reader's perspective.

### How to Beat It

**Imagine a specific reader:**
Not "general audience" but a real person. Your smart friend who doesn't work in your field. Your mother. Your past self.

**Explain the thing before using it:**
Don't use a term before defining it. Don't reference a concept before establishing it.

**Test with outsiders:**
Someone unfamiliar with the topic reveals blind spots.

## Classic Style

### The Stance

Classic style positions the writer as a guide showing the reader something in the world. The prose is a window, not a barrier.

**The writer knows something.**
**The reader can know it too.**
**The goal is to show, clearly.**

### What Classic Style Is Not

- Not academic hedging ("It might be argued that...")
- Not bureaucratic obfuscation ("Implementation will be effectuated...")
- Not self-conscious performance ("I shall endeavor to demonstrate...")

### Classic Style in Practice

> Not: "In this essay, I will argue that the data suggests a possible relationship between..."
>
> Classic: "The data reveals a pattern: when prices rise, demand falls."

The writer isn't performing analysis. The writer is showing what's there.

## The Web of Causation

### How Readers Process Ideas

Readers build mental models. Each sentence should:
1. Connect to something they already understand
2. Add something new
3. Create hooks for what's coming

### The Given-New Contract

Start with what's known; end with what's new.

> Given: "The project launched in January."
> New: "By March, it had attracted 50,000 users."

The reader anchors on "the project" (established) and receives "50,000 users" (new).

### Breaking the Contract

> Disorienting: "Fifty thousand users had signed up by March. The project launched in January."

The "50,000 users" lands before the reader has context.

---

## The Coherence of Prose

### Topic Strings

Keep the same topic in focus across sentences:

> Coherent: "The algorithm analyzed the data. It identified three patterns. These patterns suggested..."
>
> Incoherent: "The algorithm analyzed the data. Three patterns were identified. Suggestions emerged from analysis..."

In the coherent version, focus stays on the active agent.

### Thematic Progression

Ideas should progress logically:

1. Establish topic
2. Develop topic
3. Transition to related topic
4. Develop new topic

Not: Jump → Jump → Jump

### Parallel Structure

When presenting options, comparisons, or lists, keep structure parallel:

> Parallel: "The team focused on speed, accuracy, and reliability."
>
> Not parallel: "The team focused on speed, making things accurate, and reliable systems."

---

## Functional Chunks

### How We Parse Language

Readers don't process word-by-word. They chunk phrases.

A chunk that's too long overwhelms working memory:

> Overloaded: "The exceptionally talented and remarkably experienced software engineer with over twenty years of industry expertise who had previously worked at three major technology companies reviewed the code."

Better: Break it up. Front-load the subject.

> Clear: "The software engineer reviewed the code. She had twenty years of experience at three major companies."

### Heavy Noun Phrases

Academic and bureaucratic writing piles modifiers before nouns:

> Heavy: "The cross-departmental stakeholder engagement optimization initiative"

Light: Break it apart. Use verbs.

> Clear: "The initiative to improve how departments engage with stakeholders"

---

## Trees and Branches

### Sentence Structure as Tree

Every sentence has structure. The cleaner the structure, the easier to parse.

**Right-branching (easier):**
> "She opened the door and saw a room filled with people."

The sentence extends rightward, adding information.

**Left-branching (harder):**
> "Filled with people, the room she saw when she opened the door was unexpected."

The modifiers pile up before the main action.

**Center-embedded (hardest):**
> "The room that she, when she opened the door, saw was filled with people."

The interruption in the middle strains working memory.

### Practical Application

Prefer right-branching structures. When you add information, add it after the core sentence, not before.

---

## Metadiscourse

### What It Is

Metadiscourse is writing about the writing:

> "In this section, we will examine..."
> "As discussed above..."
> "It is important to note that..."

### The Problem

Metadiscourse creates distance. It's the writer talking about what they're going to say instead of saying it.

### When It's Acceptable

- Long documents needing navigation
- Transitions between major sections
- When genuinely helpful

### When to Avoid

- Short pieces
- When it's throat-clearing
- When it delays the actual content

> Instead of: "It's important to note that the deadline is Friday."
> Just say: "The deadline is Friday."

## Avoiding Zombie Nouns

### Nominalization

Turning verbs into nouns creates abstract, harder-to-process prose:

| Zombie Noun | Living Verb |
|-------------|-------------|
| implementation | implement |
| utilization | use |
| investigation | investigate |
| determination | determine |
| the development of | developing |

### Why Zombies Hurt

- They hide the actor
- They require extra words ("performed an analysis" vs. "analyzed")
- They create abstract rather than concrete prose

### Reviving Prose

Find the buried verb. Use it.

> Zombie: "The committee made a decision to conduct an investigation."
> Alive: "The committee decided to investigate."

---

## Passive Voice Reconsidered

### When Passive Is Wrong

When it hides responsibility or adds confusion:

> Evasive: "Mistakes were made."
> Clear: "We made mistakes."

### When Passive Is Right

**When the actor is unknown:**
> "The building was constructed in 1890."

**When the actor is unimportant:**
> "The data was collected over three years."

**When it maintains topic flow:**
> "The project launched in January. It was funded by a small grant."

Here, "it" (the project) stays in topic position.

### The Guideline

Not "never use passive" but "choose active or passive deliberately."

---

## Signposting and Connectives

### Explicit vs. Implicit Logic

**Explicit (heavy):**
> "First, I will discuss X. Second, I will examine Y. Third, I will consider Z."

**Implicit (light):**
> "Consider X. Now Y. And finally, Z."

### When to Signpost

- Complex arguments
- Long documents
- Transitions between major sections

### When to Let Logic Flow

- Short pieces
- When the connection is obvious
- When signposting feels mechanical

---

## Dense vs. Sparse Prose

### Dense Prose

Lots of information per sentence. Requires more cognitive effort.

> Dense: "The thermodynamically favorable, entropy-driven self-assembly process spontaneously generated hierarchically organized nanostructures."

### Sparse Prose

Less information per sentence. Easier to process.

> Sparse: "The nanostructures assembled themselves. This process was thermodynamically favorable. It was driven by entropy."

### Finding the Balance

Match density to:
- Reader expertise
- Topic complexity
- DNA document patterns

Technical readers can handle density. General readers need sparseness.

---

## Applying to Ghost Writing

### Clarity Serves Voice

Clarity isn't the opposite of voice. It's the foundation for voice.

A distinctive voice that's unclear serves no one.

### DNA First, Clarity Second

If the DNA document shows:
- Dense, complex sentences → Allow density, but maintain structure
- Sparse, simple sentences → Keep it light
- Academic hedging → That's their voice; use it

Clarity principles are defaults. DNA overrides.

### The Invisible Window

The best ghost writing is like a clear window. The reader sees the ideas, the personality, the voice. They don't see the sentence structure, the clause management, the word choices.

When writing is clear, craft becomes invisible. That's the goal.

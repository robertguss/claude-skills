# Session Flow Guide

Complete workflow for a ghost writing session, from intake to completion.

---

## Session Overview

A ghost writing session moves through these phases:

1. **Intake** — Gather requirements and assess readiness
2. **Pre-Draft Verification** — Confirm understanding and surface concerns
3. **Drafting** — Generate the drafts
4. **Output Delivery** — Present structured output
5. **Feedback Collection** — Gather structured feedback
6. **DNA Refinement** — Suggest profile updates
7. **Iteration** — Revise as needed

---

## Phase 1: Intake

### Step 1.1: Receive DNA Document

**Action:** Request or receive the Voice DNA Document.

**Checks:**
- Is this a valid DNA document from writing-dna-discovery?
- What is the Readiness Level? (Minimum Viable / Solid / Strong)
- How old is the profile? (Flag if >6 months)
- What dimensions are Strong vs. Emerging?

**If no DNA document provided:**
> "I need a Voice DNA Document to match your voice. Have you completed a session with the writing-dna-discovery skill? If not, I'd recommend starting there."

**Do not proceed without a DNA document.**

### Step 1.2: Receive Writing Task

**Action:** Accept the task description. Use hybrid approach.

**Accept free-form descriptions like:**
- "Write a blog post about why I left my corporate job"
- "I need a newsletter intro about our product launch"
- "Essay exploring the decline of physical bookstores"

**Ask targeted follow-ups only if key information is missing:**

| Missing | Follow-up Question |
|---------|-------------------|
| Topic unclear | "What specifically should this piece be about?" |
| Audience unknown | "Who's the intended audience for this?" |
| Purpose unclear | "What should readers think, feel, or do after reading?" |
| Format uncertain | "What format is this—blog, newsletter, essay, something else?" |
| Length needed | "Any length requirements or preferences?" |

**One question at a time.** Don't stack multiple questions.

### Step 1.3: Run Pre-Draft Checks

**Run through systematically:**

**Register Match Check:**
If DNA document register (e.g., "Blog") differs from task format (e.g., newsletter):
> "Your DNA document captures your blog voice, but you're asking for a newsletter. Should I apply your blog voice here, or did you mean to use a different profile?"

- If intentional cross-pollination: Note and proceed
- If accidental: Pause for correct profile

**Research Check:**
If research is provided or implied:
1. Review the research for sufficiency
2. Identify gaps: "Your research covers X and Y, but I don't see Z. Should I proceed without it, or do you have more?"
3. Summarize understanding: "My take on your research: [summary]. Accurate?"
4. Ask about citations: "How should I handle citations? Inline links, footnotes, or woven into prose?"

**Sensitive Topic Check:**
If topic is controversial, personal, or high-stakes:
> "This touches on [topic], which can be sensitive. How bold should I be?
> - Full-throated: Your direct voice without pulling punches
> - Measured: Your voice, but more careful framing
> - Your guidance: [let them specify]"

**Multiple Audience Check:**
If piece seems aimed at different readers:
> "This seems like it needs to work for both [audience A] and [audience B]. Should I:
> - Prioritize one (which?)
> - Balance both
> - Generate separate versions for each audience"

**Series Check:**
If piece seems part of a series:
> "Is this part of a series? If so, share prior parts or established patterns so I can maintain consistency."

**Derivative Work Check:**
If continuing or expanding existing content:
> "To match your existing content closely, please share what you've already written. I'll analyze it alongside your DNA document."

**Tone Modifier Check:**
If user requests a deviation:
> "You said 'more urgent than usual'—I'll layer that on top of your DNA patterns. I'll note where I adjusted."

---

## Phase 2: Pre-Draft Verification

### Step 2.1: Voice Strength Preview

**Action:** Share your assessment of DNA document strength.

> "Based on your DNA document:
> - **Strong:** [dimensions with detailed coverage]
> - **Moderate:** [dimensions with decent coverage]
> - **Light:** [dimensions with minimal or no coverage]
>
> I'll be most confident in Strong areas. Any specific guidance for the Light areas?"

**Purpose:** Set expectations and catch gaps before drafting.

### Step 2.2: Task Summary

**Action:** Summarize your understanding.

> "Here's my understanding:
> - **Topic:** [core subject]
> - **Audience:** [who they're writing for]
> - **Purpose:** [inform/persuade/entertain/inspire]
> - **Format:** [blog/newsletter/essay/etc.]
> - **Key points:** [what to cover]
> - **Approach:** [how you plan to handle it]"

**Wait for confirmation.**

### Step 2.3: Surface Concerns

**Action:** Raise any tensions or issues.

Examples:
> "One concern: Your DNA shows a casual tone, but this topic might need some authority. I'll try to balance, but review carefully."

> "Note: The research doesn't include counterarguments. Want me to address them speculatively, or skip that angle?"

> "This is a long piece (~2,500 words). Want me to deliver it complete, or work section-by-section with feedback between?"

### Step 2.4: Confirm Readiness

**Action:** Get explicit go-ahead.

> "Ready to draft?"

---

## Phase 3: Drafting

### Step 3.1: Generate Two Drafts

**Action:** Create two meaningfully different versions.

**Differences can be:**
- Structural (narrative vs. analytical)
- Opening strategy (anecdote vs. thesis-first)
- Emphasis (different aspects of topic)
- Tone variation (within documented range)

**Both drafts should:**
- Apply DNA patterns fully
- Suppress anti-patterns
- Include 2-3 headline options
- Be complete and readable

### Step 3.2: Apply Voice Patterns

**During drafting:**
- Reference DNA document's "Do This" items actively
- Avoid "Don't Do This" items strictly
- Use "When Uncertain" rules for ambiguous choices
- Match sentence rhythm, punctuation, word choice
- Mirror emotional temperature

### Step 3.3: Suppress Anti-Patterns

**During drafting:**
- Check DNA document's specific anti-patterns
- Apply baseline anti-AI patterns (from `references/anti-ai-patterns.md`)
- If you write something that feels like AI, revise immediately

### Step 3.4: Long-Form Considerations

**For pieces over 2,000 words:**
- Re-ground in DNA patterns at section breaks
- After drafting, do a voice consistency check
- Monitor for rhythm monotony
- Note any sections that may have drifted

---

## Phase 4: Output Delivery

### Step 4.1: Structure Output

**Follow the format from `references/output-format-guide.md`:**

1. Confidence Header
2. Draft A (headlines + content)
3. Draft A Notes
4. Draft B (headlines + content)
5. Draft B Notes
6. Comparison Summary
7. Consistency Check (if applicable)

### Step 4.2: Be Transparent

- Note all uncertainties
- Mark inferred patterns
- Share honest observations in Comparison
- Flag any concerns

---

## Phase 5: Feedback Collection

### Step 5.1: Ask Structured Questions

**After user reviews drafts:**

> "Before we continue, I'd like to capture what worked and what didn't:
> 1. What felt most authentically 'you' in these drafts?
> 2. Anything that felt off or not quite your voice?
> 3. Any patterns I should lean into more, or avoid going forward?"

### Step 5.2: Listen Carefully

**Map feedback to categories:**

| Feedback Type | What It Means |
|--------------|---------------|
| "That part was great" | Pattern confirmed, DNA accurate |
| "That felt off" | Potential anti-pattern surfaced |
| "I'd never say it that way" | Word choice or phrasing issue |
| "The tone wasn't right" | Temperature/formality mismatch |
| "You missed my [thing]" | Gap in DNA document |

### Step 5.3: Clarify If Needed

If feedback is vague, ask for specifics:
> "When you say it felt 'off'—was it the word choice, the tone, the structure, or something else?"

---

## Phase 6: DNA Refinement Suggestions

### Step 6.1: Translate Feedback

**Action:** Convert feedback into actionable DNA document updates.

**Format:**

> "Based on your feedback, consider these updates to your Voice DNA Document:
>
> **Add to Anti-Patterns:**
> - "[Pattern]" — [Reasoning]
>
> **Strengthen in Voice Profile:**
> - [Dimension]: [What to add or emphasize]
>
> **Add to 'Do This':**
> - [Specific instruction]
>
> **Add to 'When Uncertain':**
> - [Decision rule]
>
> You can apply these yourself or run a refinement session with the writing-dna-discovery skill."

### Step 6.2: Be Specific

- Concrete, actionable suggestions
- Include reasoning
- Reference the feedback that prompted each suggestion

---

## Phase 7: Iteration

### Step 7.1: Understand User Intent

**Listen for signals:**

| User Says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "Draft A is close, but [specific note]" | Revise A with that note |
| "Can you make it shorter/longer?" | Adjust length |
| "Neither is quite right" | Probe deeper: "What's missing?" |
| "Let's try a different angle" | Generate Draft C with new approach |
| "Good enough, I'll take it from here" | End session, offer final feedback opportunity |
| "Let's keep iterating" | Continue until satisfied |

### Step 7.2: Handle Revisions

**When revising:**
- If notes are unclear, ask: "You said 'punchier'—can you point to specific lines that need it?"
- Offer perspective: "I can shorten it, but you might lose [X]. Worth the trade-off?"
- Maintain voice consistency across versions
- Track what changed for context

### Step 7.3: Know When to Stop

**Signs the session should end:**
- User explicitly says they're satisfied
- User says they'll revise themselves
- Multiple iterations without progress (ask: "Are we getting closer, or should we try a different approach?")

- Still deliver two drafts with notes
- Note any shortcuts in Comparison

### Complex/Long Pieces

If piece is substantial:
- Offer section-by-section workflow
- More detailed Consistency Check
- May need multiple iteration rounds
- Check in more frequently

### Follow-Up Sessions

If returning with same DNA document:
- Quick DNA re-read (don't need full consumption)
- Acknowledge prior work: "Continuing from last session..."
- May have accumulated refinement suggestions to consider

### First-Time Users

If new to ghost writing:
- More explanation of process
- Clearer expectations about 80% accuracy
- More thorough feedback collection
- Emphasize collaboration

## Key Principles Throughout

1. **One question at a time** — Never stack questions
2. **Collaborative, not order-taking** — Offer perspective
3. **Transparency always** — Be honest about confidence and concerns
4. **The human decides** — Push back, but respect their choice
5. **Voice fidelity over "good writing"** — Match them, not an abstract ideal
6. **Iterate until satisfied** — The session ends when they're ready

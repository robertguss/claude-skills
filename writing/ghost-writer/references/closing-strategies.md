## The 15 Closing Strategies

### 1. The Callback

**What It Is:**
Return to an image, phrase, or scene from the opening.

**Example:**

> Opening: "At 3 a.m. on a Tuesday, I found myself debugging a script I'd written three years ago."
>
> Closing: "It's 3 a.m. again. This time, I know exactly what I'm doing."

**When to Use:**

- Transformation narratives
- When opening established a strong image
- Pieces with emotional arcs

**Effect:**
Creates completeness, shows change.

---

### 2. The Resonant Image

**What It Is:**
End with a concrete, evocative image that captures the piece's essence.

**Example:**

> "I close my laptop and step outside. The streetlights are flickering on, one by one."

**When to Use:**

- Personal essays
- Narrative pieces
- When mood matters

**Effect:**
Leaves readers with something to visualize.

---

### 3. The Kicker

**What It Is:**
End with a punchy, memorable line—often short.

**Example:**

**When to Use:**

- Argument pieces
- When confidence is earned
- Short-form content

**Effect:**
Lands with impact, memorable.

---

### 4. The Question

**What It Is:**
End by posing a question for the reader to consider.

**Example:**

> "So what are you waiting for?"

**Example (more thoughtful):**

> "The real question isn't whether we can build this. It's whether we should."

**When to Use:**

- When you want readers to keep thinking
- Exploratory pieces
- Invitations to action

**Caution:**
Don't use if it feels like avoiding commitment.

---

### 5. The Circle Close

**What It Is:**
End where you began, but with new meaning.

**Example:**

> Opening: "Everyone told me to follow my passion."
>
> Closing: "Everyone told me to follow my passion. Now I understand what they really meant."

**When to Use:**

- Transformation stories
- Pieces where meaning evolved
- After a journey

**Effect:**
Same words, different resonance.

---

### 6. The Look Forward

**What It Is:**
Project into the future—what comes next.

**Example:**

> "In ten years, this will all seem obvious. But right now, we're building it."

**When to Use:**

- Trend pieces
- After establishing current state
- When future matters

**Effect:**
Opens possibility, creates momentum.

---

### 7. The Quiet Landing

End softly, without drama—a gentle conclusion.

**Example:**

> "And so the work continues, one day at a time."

**When to Use:**

- After intense content
- When understatement fits
- Personal, reflective pieces

**Effect:**
Peaceful, contemplative.

---

**When to Use:**

- When conviction is the point
- After building the case

**Effect:**
Authoritative, conclusive.

---

### 9. The Call to Action

**What It Is:**
Directly ask the reader to do something.

**Example:**

> "Start today. Write one paragraph. See what happens."

**When to Use:**

- How-to content
- Advice pieces
- When next step matters

**Caution:**
Can feel pushy if not earned. Match to DNA.

---

### 10. The Expansion

**What It Is:**
Zoom out from the specific to the universal.

**Example:**

> "This isn't just about code reviews. It's about how we treat each other's work—how we build trust, one comment at a time."

**When to Use:**

- After specific examples
- When larger theme applies
- Pieces with philosophical undercurrent

**Effect:**
Elevates stakes, connects to bigger picture.

---

### 11. The Admission

End with an honest acknowledgment of limits or uncertainty.

**Example:**

> "I don't have all the answers. But I'm done pretending I do."

- When humility fits
- Personal essays

**Effect:**
Builds trust through honesty.

---

### 12. The Reversal

**When to Use:**

- When twist is earned
- Pieces building to insight
- After conventional setup

**Effect:**
Surprise, reframing.

---

### 13. The Quotation

**What It Is:**
End with someone else's words that encapsulate the piece.

**Example:**

> "As Hemingway said, 'There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.'"

**When to Use:**

- When quote is perfect
- Academic or literary essays
- When authority adds weight

**Caution:**
Don't end with a quote that does your work for you.

---

### 14. The Invitation

**What It Is:**
Welcome the reader into continued engagement.

**Example:**

> "Let me know what you think. The conversation is just beginning."

**When to Use:**

- Community-building content
- When dialogue matters
- Newsletters, blogs with engagement focus

**Effect:**
Opens relationship, invites response.

---

### 15. The Simple Truth

**What It Is:**
State the core insight plainly.

**Example:**

**When to Use:**

- After complex analysis
- When simplicity is powerful
- Pieces that could overcomplicate

**Effect:**
Clarity, groundedness.

## Matching Closing to Opening

Strong pieces have opening/closing resonance. The closing should feel like it belongs with the opening.

| Opening Type      | Complementary Closings                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Bold Statement    | Definitive Statement, The Kicker, Circle Close        |
| Anecdote          | Callback, Resonant Image, Circle Close                |
| Question          | Question (answered or reframed), Definitive Statement |
| Statistic         | Look Forward, Expansion, Simple Truth                 |
| In Media Res      | Resonant Image, Quiet Landing, Callback               |
| Confession        | Admission, Simple Truth, Look Forward                 |
| Problem Statement | Call to Action, Definitive Statement, Simple Truth    |

---

## Closings to Avoid

**The Summary:**

> "In conclusion, we have seen that..."
> "To summarize..."
> "In summary..."

These signal you don't trust your reader to have followed.

**The Apology:**

> "I know this was long, but..."
> "Sorry if this didn't make sense..."

Undermines the piece.

**The Fizzle:**

> "Anyway, that's just what I think."
> "So yeah, that's pretty much it."

Anticlimactic, suggests you lost interest.

**The Overpromise:**

> "This will change everything."
> "And the world was never the same."

Unless truly earned, this is empty drama.

**The Tacked-On CTA:**

> "Don't forget to like and subscribe!"

If call to action, make it organic.

## For Draft Differentiation

Use different closing strategies between drafts:

**Pair examples:**

- Draft A: Callback → Draft B: Call to Action
- Draft A: Kicker → Draft B: Question
- Draft A: Expansion → Draft B: Simple Truth

This creates meaningful difference.

---

## The Last Sentence

The final sentence carries disproportionate weight. Make it:

**Short when possible:**

> "That's what matters."
> "I'm still learning."
> "We begin again."

**Concrete rather than abstract:**

> Not: "And so the journey continues toward self-actualization."
> Better: "Tomorrow, I'll try again."

**Active rather than passive:**

> Not: "The lesson was learned."
> Better: "I learned."

**Complete:**
The reader should know the piece is over. No trailing off.

# Voice Calibration Techniques

How to apply voice patterns from the DNA document during drafting.

---

## Purpose

Reading the DNA document is one thing. Applying it sentence by sentence is another. This guide provides techniques for actively calibrating your output to match the documented voice.

---

## Before Drafting: Internalization

### The Voice Summary

Before drafting, write a one-sentence summary of the voice:

> "Direct, warm, uses short sentences with occasional long ones for emphasis, casual vocabulary, never hedges, ends paragraphs with punch."

Keep this visible during drafting.

### The Five-Pattern Focus

Identify the five most important patterns:

1. Sentence rhythm: [e.g., "Short punchy, averaging 12 words"]
2. Tone: [e.g., "Warm but not effusive"]
3. Word choice: [e.g., "Anglo-Saxon, avoids jargon"]
4. Reader relationship: [e.g., "Heavy 'you' usage, light 'I'"]
5. Distinctive move: [e.g., "Always ends with a question"]

Focus on these during drafting.

### The Anti-Pattern Alert

Identify the top 3 anti-patterns to avoid:

1. [e.g., "Never uses 'however'"]
2. [e.g., "Hates em-dashes"]
3. [e.g., "Avoids passive voice entirely"]

Watch for these throughout.

## During Drafting: Active Calibration

### The Sentence Check

After each sentence, quick check:
- Length: Within documented range?
- Words: Vocabulary level match?
- Structure: Matches rhythm pattern?

If no, revise before continuing.

### The Paragraph Check

After each paragraph, ask:
- Length: Matches documented paragraph patterns?
- Opening: Strong enough for their voice?
- Closing: Lands with appropriate weight?
- Tone: Matches temperature?

### The Anti-Pattern Scan

Periodically scan for documented anti-patterns:
- Any forbidden words used?
- Any forbidden structures appearing?
- Any AI patterns creeping in?

Fix immediately.

## Calibration Techniques by Dimension

### Sentence Rhythm

**If DNA shows short sentences:**
- Draft short, then check
- Break long sentences after drafting
- Target the documented average
- Count words if needed

**If DNA shows long, flowing sentences:**
- Allow sentences to extend
- Use clauses, parentheticals
- Watch for run-ons (still need structure)

**If DNA shows varied rhythm:**
- Consciously alternate lengths
- Follow a long with a short
- Break patterns to prevent monotony

### Punctuation

**Em-dashes:**
- If DNA shows heavy usage: Use them for asides, pivots, emphasis
- If DNA shows minimal: Avoid or use sparingly
- If DNA shows never: Find alternatives (parentheses, commas, separate sentences)

**Semicolons:**
- If DNA shows usage: Connect related clauses
- If DNA shows avoidance: Use periods instead

**Comma density:**
- High comma density: More pauses, more clauses
- Low comma density: Fewer pauses, simpler structures

### Word Choice

**Vocabulary calibration:**
- Pull 5-10 words from "Favorite Words" in DNA
- Actively use them where appropriate
- Pull words from "Avoided Words"
- Never use them

**Anglo-Saxon vs. Latinate:**
- If Anglo-Saxon: "start" not "commence," "use" not "utilize"
- If Latinate: More formal vocabulary appropriate

**Contractions:**
- If DNA shows always: Don't → don't, cannot → can't
- If DNA shows never: Expand all contractions

### Tone

**Warm voice calibration:**
- Include more personal markers
- Use "you" directly
- Allow enthusiasm where appropriate
- Softer transitions

**Cool voice calibration:**
- More measured statements
- Fewer exclamations
- More analytical structure
- Distance in pronouns

**Direct voice calibration:**
- Lead with conclusions
- Fewer qualifiers
- Active voice throughout
- Shorter sentences

**Exploratory voice calibration:**
- Allow questions
- Permit uncertainty
- Show the thinking
- Longer, more complex sentences

### Reader Relationship

**Heavy "I" presence:**
- Personal anecdotes
- First-person reflections
- "I think," "I believe," "I've found"

**Light "I" presence:**
- Focus on ideas, not personal
- Passive or "we" constructions
- Third-person framing

**Heavy "you" presence:**
- Direct address
- "You might notice," "Consider your own..."
- Reader is participant

**Light "you" presence:**
- Ideas stand alone
- Reader is observer
- Less direct address

## The Exemplar Technique

### Using DNA Exemplars

The DNA document contains Exemplar Passages. Use them as calibration tools:

1. Read an exemplar before drafting a similar section
2. Note specific patterns: sentence length, word choice, rhythm
3. Draft your section
4. Compare: Does it feel like the exemplar?
5. Adjust until it does

### Side-by-Side Calibration

Put exemplar and draft side by side:

| Exemplar | Draft |
|----------|-------|
| "The code was wrong. Simple as that." | "The code contained errors that needed fixing." |

Ask: Do these sound like the same person?

If not: Revise the draft.

## The Substitution Technique

When a word or phrase doesn't match the voice:

### Step 1: Identify the Mismatch
> "The methodology was implemented..."

Feels too formal for a casual voice.

### Step 2: Check DNA for Alternatives
- Favorite words list
- Vocabulary level guidance
- Exemplar passages

### Step 3: Substitute
> "We tried the approach..."

### Step 4: Verify
Does it now match the voice?

---

## The Temperature Check

Voice has an emotional "temperature." Periodically check:

### Is the Temperature Right?

**If DNA is warm:**
- Are there personal touches?
- Does it feel approachable?
- Is there any coldness creeping in?

**If DNA is cool:**
- Is it measured and analytical?
- Are there inappropriate moments of warmth?
- Is the distance consistent?

### Adjusting Temperature

**Warming up:**
- Add personal pronouns
- Soften language
- Include relatable details
- Show enthusiasm where appropriate

**Cooling down:**
- Remove excessive qualifiers
- Reduce personal anecdotes
- More objective framing
- Measured assertions

## When Patterns Conflict

Sometimes DNA patterns seem to conflict. Resolution:

### Step 1: Check "When Uncertain" Rules

The DNA document may have explicit guidance.

### Step 2: Apply Hierarchy

- Specific instructions > general tendencies
- Briefing section > profile section
- Documented patterns > inferred patterns

### Step 3: Pick and Document

If truly ambiguous:
- Pick the more conservative option
- Note the choice in draft notes
- Flag for user feedback

---

## Calibration for Different Drafts

When creating two drafts, calibrate differently:

### Draft A: Emphasize One Pattern Set
- Lean into narrative patterns
- More personal approach
- Longer, flowing sentences

### Draft B: Emphasize Another Pattern Set
- Lean into analytical patterns
- More structured approach
- Shorter, punchier sentences

Both should be within the DNA range, but at different points in that range.

---

## Post-Draft Calibration Check

After drafting, before delivery:

### The Voice Audit

1. Read the opening → Does it sound like them?
2. Read the middle → Consistent with opening?
3. Read the closing → Same voice throughout?
4. Check sentence lengths → In documented range?
5. Check word choice → Favorites used, avoided avoided?
6. Check punctuation → Matches personality?
7. Check anti-patterns → None present?

### The Exemplar Comparison

Could this draft be placed next to their exemplar passages without seeming like a different person?

If no: Identify where the drift occurred and fix.

---

## Common Calibration Errors

### 1. Over-Applying One Pattern

Focusing on one pattern (e.g., short sentences) while neglecting others (e.g., vocabulary level).

**Fix:** Balance attention across dimensions.

### 2. Mechanical Application

Following patterns rigidly without considering context.

**Fix:** Apply patterns thoughtfully, not robotically.

### 3. Losing the Spirit

Matching mechanics but missing the feel.

**Fix:** Read exemplars to internalize the spirit, not just the patterns.

### 4. Inconsistent Application

Starting strong, drifting by the end.

**Fix:** Periodic re-grounding at section breaks.

# Brainstorming Methods - Quick Reference

Quick selection guide. For full explanations, see `methods-detailed.md`.

## Divergent Methods (Generate New Ideas)

| Method | Best For | One-liner |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **SCAMPER** | Improving existing concepts | Systematic prompts: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse |
| **Random Stimulus** | Breaking mental ruts | Introduce unrelated word/image, force connections |
| **Forced Analogies** | Fresh perspectives | "How would [X industry/person] solve this?" |
| **Mind Mapping** | Exploring idea space | Visual branching from central concept |
| **Worst Possible Idea** | Loosening constraints | Generate terrible ideas, then invert |
| **TRIZ Principles** | Technical/product problems | 40 inventive principles for contradiction resolution |

## Convergent Methods (Focus & Decide)

| Method | Best For | One-liner |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Affinity Grouping** | Organizing many ideas | Cluster similar ideas, name the clusters |
| **Dot Voting** | Quick prioritization | Allocate limited votes across options |
| **Weighted Scoring** | Complex decisions | Score options against weighted criteria |
| **Elimination Rounds** | Narrowing options | Progressive cuts with explicit criteria |
| **2x2 Matrix** | Comparing tradeoffs | Plot options on two key dimensions |

## Problem-Framing Methods

| Method | Best For | One-liner |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **First Principles** | Fundamental rethinking | Strip to basics, rebuild from ground truth |
| **5 Whys** | Root cause analysis | Ask "why" repeatedly to find core issue |
| **Inversion** | Finding hidden risks | "What guarantees failure?" then avoid it |
| **Problem Reframing** | Stuck on wrong problem | Restate the problem 5 different ways |
| **Jobs-to-be-Done** | Product/service design | What job is the user hiring this to do? |

## Perspective Shift Methods

| Method | Best For | One-liner |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Six Thinking Hats** | Structured group analysis | Rotate through facts, feelings, risks, benefits, creativity, process |
| **Steelman** | Testing ideas rigorously | Build the strongest case for the opposing view |
| **Audience Reality Check** | Product/content validation | Would [specific person] actually want this? |
| **Stakeholder Mapping** | Complex decisions | Who cares, what do they want, what's their power? |
| **Time Horizons** | Strategic thinking | How does this look in 1 week / 1 year / 10 years? |

## Evaluation & Risk Methods

| Method | Best For | One-liner |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Pre-mortem** | Before committing | Assume it failed—why? |
| **Assumption Surfacing** | Foundational clarity | What are we taking for granted? |
| **10/10/10** | Decision clarity | How will I feel about this in 10 min / 10 months / 10 years? |
| **Reversibility Test** | Risk assessment | Is this a one-way or two-way door? |

## Theological/Philosophical Methods

| Method | Best For | One-liner |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Presuppositional Analysis** | Deep foundations | What worldview assumptions underlie this idea? |
| **Telos Examination** | Purpose clarity | What is the ultimate end/purpose this serves? |
| **Stewardship Frame** | Resource decisions | Am I being a faithful steward of what's entrusted to me? |

## Quick Selection Heuristics

- **"I have no ideas"** → Random Stimulus, Worst Possible Idea
- **"I have too many ideas"** → Affinity Grouping, Elimination Rounds
- **"I'm not sure what the real problem is"** → 5 Whys, Problem Reframing
- **"This feels risky"** → Pre-mortem, Inversion
- **"Am I missing something?"** → Six Thinking Hats, Steelman
- **"Is this actually valuable?"** → Jobs-to-be-Done, Audience Reality Check
- **"What are we assuming?"** → First Principles, Assumption Surfacing, Presuppositional Analysis

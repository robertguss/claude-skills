## Recommended Methods by Session Type

### Product/SaaS Ideation

**Core questions to answer:**

- What problem does this solve?
- Who specifically has this problem?
- Why would they choose this over alternatives?
- Can I build it? Should I?

**Recommended methods:**

1. **Jobs-to-be-Done** — Understand the real need
2. **Audience Reality Check** — Validate the target user exists
3. **Competitive Analysis** — Map the landscape
4. **First Principles** — Challenge inherited assumptions
5. **Pre-mortem** — Identify failure modes before committing

**Watch out for:** Falling in love with the solution before validating the problem.

### Content Ideation (Newsletter, Articles, Books)

**Core questions to answer:**

- What does my audience need to hear?
- What do I have unique insight on?
- What's the angle that makes this mine?
- How does this fit my larger body of work?

**Recommended methods:**

1. **Mind Mapping** — Explore the idea space
2. **Audience Reality Check** — Who specifically wants this?
3. **Forced Analogies** — Find fresh angles
4. **SCAMPER** — Vary existing ideas
5. **Telos Examination** — Why does this content matter?

**Watch out for:** Writing what's easy instead of what's needed; chasing trends over building a body of work.

### Strategic Decision

**Core questions to answer:**

- What are my actual options?
- What matters most in this decision?
- What am I assuming?
- What's the risk profile?

**Recommended methods:**

1. **First Principles** — Clear away assumptions
2. **Weighted Scoring** — Make tradeoffs explicit
3. **Pre-mortem** — Test your leading option
4. **Steelman** — Argue for options you're dismissing
5. **10/10/10** — Check against time horizons

**Watch out for:** Deciding before actually exploring options; confirmation bias.

### Problem Solving

**Core questions to answer:**

- What's the real problem? (Not the symptom)
- What have I tried?
- What assumptions am I making?
- What would make this easy?

**Recommended methods:**

1. **5 Whys** — Find the root cause
2. **Problem Reframing** — Restate the problem multiple ways
3. **Inversion** — What would guarantee failure?
4. **Forced Analogies** — How do other domains solve this?
5. **First Principles** — Strip to fundamentals

**Watch out for:** Solving the wrong problem; jumping to solutions too fast.

### Business Model / Monetization

**Core questions to answer:**

- Who pays? For what value?
- What's the pricing psychology?
- How does this scale?
- What's sustainable long-term?

**Recommended methods:**

1. **Jobs-to-be-Done** — What are they really buying?
2. **Forced Analogies** — How do similar businesses price?
3. **First Principles** — What is price really?
4. **Assumption Surfacing** — What must be true for this model to work?
5. **Stewardship Frame** — Is this pricing faithful/fair?

**Watch out for:** Underpricing; copying models that don't fit; leaving money on the table.

---

### Positioning / Marketing

**Core questions to answer:**

- Who is this for? (specifically)
- What makes this different?
- What's the one thing to remember?
- Why should they believe me?

**Recommended methods:**

1. **Audience Reality Check** — Get specific about who
2. **Steelman** — Argue for competitors
3. **Inversion** — How would I make this forgettable?
4. **SCAMPER** — Vary the positioning
5. **Forced Analogies** — How do non-competitors position?

**Watch out for:** Being everything to everyone; forgettable positioning; claiming differentiation that doesn't matter to the audience.

## Session Energy Modes

### Deep Exploration Mode

**Characteristics:** Long session, open-ended, divergent, willing to go down rabbit holes.

**Approach:**

- Use divergent methods freely
- Allow tangents (but park off-topic items)
- Don't rush to converge
- Embrace ambiguity
- End with synthesis, not decisions

### Quick Progress Mode

**Characteristics:** Short session, focused, need to move forward, decisions over exploration.

**Approach:**

- Start with clear scope: "What decision do we need to make today?"
- Use convergent methods primarily
- Time-box divergent exploration (10 min max)
- Make decisions and log them
- End with next actions

## Mode Selection: Connected vs. Clean-Slate

### Connected Mode (Default)

Cross-reference other projects and existing work. Surface connections like:

- "This relates to your thinking on X"
- "You explored something similar in [project]"
- "This might conflict with what you decided about Y"
- "This could feed into your newsletter/book/other project"

**Best for:** Building on existing work, ensuring consistency, leveraging past thinking.

### Clean-Slate Mode

No references to other projects or prior work. Fresh perspective.

**Best for:** Genuinely new territory, avoiding anchoring, testing ideas without baggage.

**When to suggest clean-slate:** When the user seems anchored on past approaches that aren't working, or when fresh thinking would benefit from starting over.

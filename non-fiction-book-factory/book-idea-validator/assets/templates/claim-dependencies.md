## Purpose

Maps logical dependencies between claims. Some claims are foundational; others build on them. This reveals which claims are load-bearing and helps architect structure the argument.

---

## Dependency Map

### Foundational Claims (No Dependencies)

These claims stand on their own and support other claims:

| Claim # | Claim   | Supports                               |
| ------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| [#]     | [Claim] | [List of claim #s that depend on this] |

---

### Dependent Claims

These claims require other claims to be established first:

| Claim # | Claim   | Depends On | Strength of Dependency   |
| ------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| [#]     | [Claim] | [Claim #s] | [Essential / Supporting] |

**Dependency Strength:**

- **Essential** — If the foundation fails, this claim collapses
- **Supporting** — Foundation strengthens but isn't required

---

## Dependency Chains

Sequences where claims build on each other:

### Chain [#]: [Name/Theme]

```
[Claim #] → [Claim #] → [Claim #] → [Claim #]
   ↓
[Claim #]
```

**Narrative:** [Brief explanation of how these connect]

### Chain [#]: [Name/Theme]

[Repeat structure]

## Load-Bearing Analysis

**Most Critical Claims:**  
Claims that, if they fail, cause multiple other claims to fall:

| Claim # | Claim   | Claims That Fall If This Fails |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| [#]     | [Claim] | [List]                         |

**Implication for Validation:**  
[Which claims need the strongest evidence?]

---

## Isolated Claims

Claims that don't depend on others and nothing depends on them:

| Claim # | Claim   | Notes                                      |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| [#]     | [Claim] | [Could be cut without affecting argument?] |

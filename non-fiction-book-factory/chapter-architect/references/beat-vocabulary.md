# Beat Vocabulary Reference

A beat is a single unit of the reader's experience—a moment where something shifts in their understanding, feeling, or engagement. This reference provides a vocabulary of common beat types to draw from during brainstorming.

**How to use this document:** During Phase 2 (Brainstorm Beats), review these categories to generate ideas. Not every chapter needs every type. Use this as a menu, not a checklist.

## Using This Vocabulary

During brainstorming:
1. Review the categories that seem relevant to your chapter
2. Generate candidate beats without sequencing
3. Use the vocabulary to spot gaps: "Do we have any evidence beats? Any tension beats?"
4. Don't force beats that don't serve the reader

During sequencing:
1. Consider which beat types naturally precede or follow others
2. Watch for monotony—too many of the same type in a row
3. Ensure emotional variety alongside intellectual progression

Remember: This vocabulary describes what beats *do*, not what they must contain. A "hook" beat might be a question, a story, a statistic, or a provocative claim—the execution is the ghostwriter's creative domain.

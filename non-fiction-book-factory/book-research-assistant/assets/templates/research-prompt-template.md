## 3. The Research Gap

**Gap ID:** [CH##-GAP-##]

**Priority:** [P1 / P2 / P3]

- P1: Book fails without this
- P2: Significantly strengthens the argument
- P3: Nice to have

**The Question:** [Clear, specific statement of what we need to find out]

**Why This Matters:** [How this gap connects to the chapter's purpose and the book's thesis]

---

## 4. Author's Existing Position

**What I Already Know/Believe:**
[Brief summary of the author's current understanding of this topic]

**What Is Genuinely Unknown:**
[What the author doesn't know and needs research to discover]

**What Needs Evidence:**
[Claims the author believes but needs supporting evidence for]

---

## 5. Evidence Type Needed

Check all that apply and note specifics:

- [ ] **Statistical/Data** — [Specify: what kind of numbers, from what sources]
- [ ] **Case Studies** — [Specify: what kind of examples, from what domains]
- [ ] **Expert Quotes** — [Specify: what fields, what perspectives]
- [ ] **Historical Examples** — [Specify: what time period, what context]
- [ ] **Experimental/Research Findings** — [Specify: what disciplines, what methodologies]
- [ ] **Anecdotal/Illustrative** — [Specify: what kind of stories]
- [ ] **Counterarguments** — [Specify: what objections need addressing]

**Primary Need:** [Which type is MOST important for this gap]

---

## 6. Scope & Boundaries

**Depth Calibration:**
[How much is enough? E.g., "Enough to support 2-3 paragraphs" or "Cornerstone claim requiring substantial evidence from multiple sources"]

**Recency Requirements:**
[E.g., "Last 2-3 years critical" or "Historical depth needed back to origins" or "Timeless—recency less important"]

**Geographic/Cultural Scope:**
[E.g., "Global perspective" or "Western/US focus" or "Cross-cultural comparison needed"]

**What NOT to Include:**
[Tangents to avoid, topics covered elsewhere in the book, common rabbit holes]

---

## 7. Source Requirements

**Bibliographic Standard:**
All sources must include: Author name(s), title, publication/publisher, date, page numbers (if applicable), DOI or URL. Use Chicago citation format.

**Source Hierarchy (prioritize in this order):**

1. Primary sources (original research, firsthand accounts, official documents)
2. Peer-reviewed academic sources
3. Reputable journalism and established publications
4. Expert commentary and analysis
5. General web sources (use sparingly, verify carefully)

**Required Distinctions:**

- **Primary vs. Secondary:** Flag whether each source is the original research/statement or someone citing it
- **Verification Confidence:** Distinguish between sources actually retrieved and read vs. sources known from training data
- **Source Strength:** Rate how directly each source supports the claim (Directly supports / Tangentially related / Provides context)
- **Accessibility:** Note if paywalled, freely available, or requires special access

**Conflicting Sources:**
If sources disagree, note the conflict explicitly rather than resolving it. Present both positions with their evidence.

---

## 8. Quality Criteria

**What "Good Enough" Looks Like:**
[Specific description of minimum acceptable research for this gap]

**Minimum Threshold:**
[E.g., "At least 2-3 concrete examples with full citations" or "Data from 2+ independent studies" or "Expert perspective from recognized authority in the field"]

**Red Flags to Avoid:**

- Unsourced claims
- Secondary sources citing other secondary sources
- Data without methodology transparency
- Expert opinions outside their domain
- Sources with clear ideological bias without acknowledgment

---

## 9. Search Guidance

**Suggested Angles:**
[2-3 different approaches to researching this question]

**Search Terms to Try:**
[Specific keywords, phrases, Boolean combinations]

**Source Types to Prioritize:**
[E.g., academic journals, industry reports, government data, specific publications]

**Experts/Authors to Look For:**
[Names of known authorities in this area, if any]

**Domains to Explore:**
[Specific websites, databases, archives that might have relevant material]

---

## 10. Special Requests

**Quotability:**
Find exact quotes with full attribution that could be used directly in the manuscript. Prioritize memorable, well-phrased statements from credible sources.

**Steelman:**
Identify and present the strongest counterarguments to this claim or position. What would a thoughtful critic say? What evidence supports the opposing view?

**Expert Identification:**
Beyond sources, who are the leading voices on this topic? Names to potentially cite, quote, or research further.

**Visual/Data Opportunities:**
Flag any data, statistics, or comparisons that could become a table, chart, or figure in the book.

**Connection Flags:**
If you find anything relevant to other chapters or topics in the book, note it separately at the end. Specifically watch for connections to: [list any relevant chapters or themes]

## 11. Output Format

Structure your response as follows:

### Summary of Findings

2-3 paragraphs synthesizing what was discovered. Lead with the most important findings.

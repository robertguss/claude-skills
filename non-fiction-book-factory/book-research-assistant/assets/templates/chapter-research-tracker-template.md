**Origin Key:**

- Architect — Came from Research Gaps Document
- RA-Expanded — Architect's gap was split into multiple questions
- RA-Added — New gap identified by research-assistant

**Status Key:**

- ⬜ Pending — Not yet started
- 📝 Prompt Ready — Prompt generated, not yet run
- 🔍 In Review — Research submitted, awaiting validation
- ✅ Complete — Validated and sufficient
- 🔄 Needs More — Requires follow-up research
- ⚠️ Problematic — Thesis tension or issue requiring decision

**Verdict Key:**

- Strong — Exceeds needs
- Adequate — Meets needs
- Thin — Minimally acceptable
- Conflicting — Sources disagree

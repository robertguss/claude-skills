# Contradiction Reconciliation

How to handle conflicting information between sources, between Claude and Gemini outputs, and within research findings.

---

## Types of Contradictions

### 1. Factual Contradictions

Sources disagree on facts: dates, numbers, names, events.

**Example:** Source A says Luhmann created 90,000 cards; Source B says 70,000.

### 2. Interpretive Contradictions

Sources agree on facts but disagree on meaning or significance.

**Example:** Both sources agree handwriting activates more brain regions; they disagree on whether this matters for learning.

### 3. Methodological Contradictions

Different research approaches yield different conclusions.

**Example:** Laboratory studies show X; field studies show Y.

### 4. Temporal Contradictions

Information was true at one time but has changed.

**Example:** 2015 research showed X; 2023 research contradicts with new evidence.

### 5. Scope Contradictions

Something is true in one context but not another.

**Example:** Finding holds for students but not professionals; holds in US but not internationally.

### 6. Model Contradictions

Claude and Gemini return conflicting information.

## Core Principle: Present, Don't Resolve

**Do NOT:**

- Artificially choose one side
- Smooth over genuine disagreements
- Present false consensus
- Hide contradictions from the author

**DO:**

- Present both positions clearly
- Show the evidence on each side
- Assess relative strength
- Let the author decide

## Evaluation Framework

When sources conflict, assess:

### 1. Source Quality Comparison

| Factor                   | Source A | Source B |
| ------------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| Type (primary/secondary) |          |          |
| Peer-reviewed?           |          |          |
| Author credentials       |          |          |
| Publication venue        |          |          |
| Methodology rigor        |          |          |
| Conflicts of interest    |          |          |

Higher quality source gets more weight, but doesn't automatically "win."

### 2. Evidence Strength Comparison

| Factor                       | Source A | Source B |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Sample size                  |          |          |
| Methodology type             |          |          |
| Replication status           |          |          |
| Recency                      |          |          |
| Direct vs. indirect evidence |          |          |

### 3. Nature of Disagreement

Is this disagreement about:

- **Facts?** → One is likely wrong; check sources
- **Interpretation?** → Both may be valid perspectives
- **Scope?** → Both may be right in different contexts
- **Methods?** → Different approaches may yield different valid results

## Handling Specific Contradiction Types

### Factual Contradictions

**Step 1:** Try to verify against primary/original sources
**Step 2:** Check for transcription or citation errors
**Step 3:** Look for more recent/authoritative sources
**Step 4:** If unresolvable, present both with confidence assessment

**Template for presenting:**

> Sources disagree on [specific fact]. Source A ([citation]) claims [X], while Source B ([citation]) claims [Y]. Source A appears more reliable because [reason]. However, this should be verified before publication.

### Interpretive Contradictions

These are often legitimate differences in perspective.

**Template for presenting:**

> Experts disagree on the significance of [finding]. [Expert A] argues [interpretation], citing [evidence]. [Expert B] counters that [alternative interpretation], based on [their evidence]. The author should consider which interpretation better serves the book's argument.

### Methodological Contradictions

Different methods can yield different valid findings.

**Template for presenting:**

> Laboratory studies (e.g., [citation]) show [X], while field research (e.g., [citation]) shows [Y]. This discrepancy may reflect [possible explanation: artificial conditions vs. real-world complexity / different populations / different measures]. Both findings may be valid in their respective contexts.

### Temporal Contradictions

More recent doesn't automatically mean more correct.

**Step 1:** Understand why findings changed
**Step 2:** Check if new research supersedes or just adds nuance
**Step 3:** Consider if the change reflects real-world change or improved methods

**Template for presenting:**

> Earlier research ([date], [citation]) found [X]. More recent work ([date], [citation]) suggests [Y]. The change appears to reflect [reason: new evidence / improved methods / changed conditions]. The author should cite [recommendation based on context].

### Scope Contradictions

Both may be true in different contexts.

**Template for presenting:**

> This finding appears context-dependent. Research shows [X] in [context A] ([citation]) but [Y] in [context B] ([citation]). The author should specify which context applies to their book's audience.

## Handling Claude vs. Gemini Contradictions

When the two models return conflicting information:

### Step 1: Identify the Exact Disagreement

What specifically do they disagree about? A fact? An interpretation? A source?

### Step 2: Check Source Overlap

Did they cite the same or different sources?

- **Same sources, different interpretations:** Compare how each processed the source
- **Different sources:** Evaluate source quality on each side

### Step 3: Look for Verification Flags

Did either model mark claims as [Retrieved] vs. [Training]?

- Retrieved information is generally more reliable
- Training knowledge may include hallucinations

### Step 4: Attempt Third-Party Verification

For critical claims, verify independently:

- Search for the cited source directly
- Check if the claim appears in the source
- Look for additional corroboration

### Step 5: Present the Conflict

If unresolvable through verification:

**Template:**

> Claude's research indicates [X], citing [sources]. Gemini's research indicates [Y], citing [sources]. Key differences:
>
> - [Difference 1]
> - [Difference 2]
>
> Assessment: [Which seems more reliable and why, or acknowledgment of genuine uncertainty]
>
> Recommendation: [What the author should do—additional research, choose based on criteria, acknowledge uncertainty in the book]

## When to Flag for Author Decision

Escalate to the author when:

1. **Both positions are defensible** — No clear winner on evidence
2. **Contradiction affects thesis** — The book's argument depends on which is true
3. **P1 evidence is contested** — Critical claim has conflicting evidence
4. **New information challenges assumptions** — Research contradicts what the book planned to argue
5. **Expert consensus doesn't exist** — Genuine ongoing debate among authorities

**Template for flagging:**

> ⚠️ **Author Decision Required**
>
> **Contradiction:** [Describe the conflict]
>
> **Position A:** [Statement with evidence and sources]
> **Position B:** [Statement with evidence and sources]
>
> **My Assessment:** [Your analysis of relative strength]
>
> **Impact on Book:** [How this affects the chapter/thesis]
>
> **Options:**
>
> 1. [Option with implications]
> 2. [Option with implications]
> 3. [Option with implications]
>
> **Recommendation:** [Your suggested path forward]

## Documenting Contradictions

In the Chapter Research Summary, document significant contradictions:

### Contradictions Section Format

| Topic   | Position A       | Position B       | Resolution/Status                                          |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Topic] | [Claim + source] | [Claim + source] | Resolved: [how] / Flagged for author / Presented as debate |

---

## Using Contradictions in the Book

Contradictions aren't always problems—they can be opportunities:

### For Credibility

Acknowledging disagreement shows intellectual honesty:

> "Scholars debate whether [X or Y]..."

### For Nuance

Contradictions often reveal complexity:

> "In laboratory settings, [X]. In real-world conditions, [Y]. The difference suggests..."

### For Engagement

Debates can be interesting:

> "This remains an open question. [Expert A] argues... while [Expert B] counters..."

### For Positioning

The author can take a stance:

> "While some argue [X], the evidence for [Y] is stronger because..."

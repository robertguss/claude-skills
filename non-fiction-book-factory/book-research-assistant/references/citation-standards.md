# Citation Standards

Chicago Manual of Style citation format for nonfiction books, with guidance on complete bibliographic information and annotation.

---

## Why Chicago Style

Chicago is the standard for nonfiction book publishing. Using it from the research phase means:

- Citations are ready for the manuscript
- Fact-checker can verify sources
- Bibliography can be compiled directly
- Professional credibility from the start

---

## Core Principle: Complete Information

Every citation must include enough information for someone to:

1. Find the source
2. Verify the claim
3. Assess the source's credibility

When in doubt, include more information rather than less.

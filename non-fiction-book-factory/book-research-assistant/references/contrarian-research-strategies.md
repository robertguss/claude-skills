# Contrarian Research Strategies

How to research claims that go against conventional wisdom—essential for books with contrarian theses that challenge what readers believe.

---

## The Contrarian Research Challenge

Books with contrarian theses face unique research challenges:

1. **Evidence may be harder to find** — Conventional wisdom often has more studies, more experts, more citations
2. **Selection bias temptation** — Easy to cherry-pick supporting evidence
3. **Credibility hurdle** — Readers will be skeptical; evidence must be stronger
4. **Strawman risk** — Easy to argue against a weak version of the opposition
5. **Echo chamber danger** — Finding only sources that already agree

A contrarian book needs _better_ research, not just _different_ research.

## Core Strategy: Steelman the Opposition

### What Steelmanning Means

Present the **strongest** version of the argument you're challenging—not a weak version that's easy to defeat.

**Strawman:** "People who prefer digital notes are just addicted to technology."
**Steelman:** "Digital notes offer searchability, portability, cloud backup, multimedia integration, and collaboration features that paper cannot match. Leading productivity experts like [Name] recommend digital systems, and studies show [specific benefit]."

### Why Steelmanning Matters

1. **Credibility:** Readers respect intellectual honesty
2. **Persuasion:** Defeating a strong argument is more convincing
3. **Completeness:** You may discover your position needs refinement
4. **Trust:** Readers who hold the conventional view feel heard
5. **Durability:** Your argument survives if you've addressed the best counterpoints

### How to Research the Steelman

**Explicit prompt element:**

> "Present the strongest case AGAINST my thesis. Find the best evidence, the most credible experts, and the most compelling arguments for the opposing view. Steelman, don't strawman."

**Sources to seek:**

- Leading advocates of the conventional view
- Most-cited papers supporting the opposition
- Strongest empirical evidence for the other side
- Most common objections from practitioners

## The Contrarian Research Protocol

### Step 1: Establish What You're Challenging

Be precise about the conventional wisdom:

- Who believes it? (Everyone? Experts? A specific community?)
- Why do they believe it? (Evidence? Authority? Intuition? Tradition?)
- How strongly do they believe it? (Tentatively? Dogmatically?)

### Step 2: Research the Conventional View First

Before researching your contrarian position, deeply understand what you're challenging:

**Prompt:**

> "What is the strongest case for [conventional view]? What evidence supports it? Who are its most credible advocates? What would I need to believe to hold this view?"

This prevents:

- Attacking a strawman
- Missing important nuances
- Being blindsided by strong counterarguments

### Step 3: Find the Cracks

Look for:

- **Anomalies:** Findings that don't fit the conventional view
- **Dissenting experts:** Credible voices questioning consensus
- **Methodological critiques:** Problems with supporting research
- **Scope limitations:** Where the conventional wisdom doesn't apply
- **Historical shifts:** Previous conventional wisdom that was wrong

**Prompt:**

> "What are the anomalies, dissenting views, methodological critiques, and limitations of [conventional view]? Where does the evidence not fully support it?"

### Step 4: Build Your Contrarian Case

Now research your position:

- What evidence directly supports your view?
- What alternative explains the evidence better?
- What new evidence exists that challenges convention?

**Prompt:**

> "What evidence supports [contrarian view]? What studies, experts, or examples suggest [conventional wisdom] is wrong or incomplete?"

### Step 5: Anticipate Rebuttals

What will defenders of conventional wisdom say to your argument?

**Prompt:**

> "How would a strong defender of [conventional view] respond to [contrarian evidence/argument]? What would they say to dismiss or minimize it?"

Prepare responses to likely rebuttals.

## Evidence Standards for Contrarian Claims

### The Higher Bar

Contrarian claims need stronger evidence because:

- You're asking readers to change their minds
- You're going against expert consensus (if applicable)
- You'll face skeptical reading

**Proof burden escalation:**
| Claim Type | Normal Burden | Contrarian Burden |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Supporting point | Light | Medium |
| Significant claim | Medium | Heavy |
| Central thesis | Heavy | Extraordinary |

### What "Extraordinary Evidence" Looks Like

For core contrarian claims:

- Multiple independent lines of evidence
- At least some primary sources
- Peer-reviewed research (not just opinion)
- Expert voices breaking from consensus (ideally)
- Counterarguments explicitly addressed
- Limitations acknowledged

### Dealing with Evidence Asymmetry

Conventional wisdom often has more studies simply because it's been studied more. Strategies:

1. **Quality over quantity:** One rigorous study can outweigh ten weak ones
2. **Question the studies:** Examine methodology of supporting research
3. **Reframe the evidence:** Sometimes the same evidence supports a different conclusion
4. **Identify gaps:** What hasn't been studied that would test your view?
5. **Logical argument:** Sometimes reasoning can supplement limited empirical evidence

## Finding Contrarian Sources

### Dissenting Experts

Look for:

- Credentialed experts who disagree with mainstream view
- Researchers who've published critiques
- Practitioners with different experience than the consensus
- Scholars from adjacent fields with fresh perspective

**Prompt:**

> "Which credentialed experts or researchers have argued against [conventional view]? What are their credentials and arguments?"

### Methodological Critics

Find those who challenge the _research base_ for conventional wisdom:

**Prompt:**

> "What methodological critiques have been made of the research supporting [conventional view]? What are the limitations of the key studies?"

### Historical Parallels

Past examples of overturned conventional wisdom:

**Prompt:**

> "What are historical examples of [similar type of] conventional wisdom that was later overturned? What allowed the new view to emerge?"

### Adjacent Field Perspectives

Different disciplines may see the question differently:

**Prompt:**

> "How do experts in [related field] view [topic]? Do they agree with the conventional wisdom in [main field]?"

## Handling Specific Contrarian Challenges

### "But All the Experts Agree!"

**Response strategies:**

1. Find dissenting experts (they often exist)
2. Examine why experts agree (evidence? groupthink? incentives?)
3. Note historical examples of expert consensus being wrong
4. Distinguish expert opinion from expert evidence
5. Identify the scope of actual agreement (they may agree on less than it seems)

### "There's So Much Research Supporting [Conventional View]"

**Response strategies:**

1. Quality audit: How rigorous are the key studies?
2. Replication check: Have findings been replicated?
3. Publication bias: Are contrary findings not published?
4. Funding bias: Who funded the research?
5. Scope check: Do studies actually test what they claim to test?

### "Why Should I Believe You Over [Authority]?"

**Response strategies:**

1. Present your evidence, not just your opinion
2. Show the authority may be wrong on this specific point
3. Distinguish credentialed authority from epistemic authority
4. Point to authorities who agree with you
5. Appeal to reader's own reasoning and experience

## The Contrarian Writing Stance

Research shapes not just _what_ you write but _how_:

### Tone Recommendations

**Avoid:**

- Dismissiveness toward opposing view
- Stridency or overconfidence
- Us-vs-them framing
- Condescension toward those who disagree

**Prefer:**

- Respect for intelligent disagreement
- Appropriate humility about your own view
- "Here's what I've found, judge for yourself"
- Acknowledgment of what opposition gets right

### Framing Recommendations

**Less persuasive:**

> "The conventional wisdom is completely wrong and here's why..."

**More persuasive:**

> "The conventional wisdom has merit, but overlooked evidence suggests a different view. Here's what I found..."

## Specific to "A Critique of Truth"

Robert's book argues that philosophy has failed because truth is a Person (Christ), not a proposition—a deeply contrarian thesis in secular philosophy.

**Research considerations:**

1. **Steelman secular epistemology:** Research the strongest defenses of propositional truth, correspondence theory, etc.

2. **Find the cracks:** Where has secular epistemology struggled? (Gettier problems, epistemic regress, the problem of criterion)

3. **Build from strength:** Van Til, Reformed epistemology, presuppositional apologetics—what's the best scholarly work?

4. **Anticipate objections:** "This is just theology, not philosophy" — how do Christian philosophers respond?

5. **Historical depth:** How did philosophy move away from truth-as-personal? What's the history of this shift?

6. **Contemporary voices:** Are there philosophers (even secular ones) questioning propositional-only accounts of truth?

## Quality Check: Contrarian Research

Before finalizing contrarian chapter research, verify:

- [ ] Conventional view is steelmanned, not strawmanned
- [ ] Strongest counterarguments are identified
- [ ] Evidence meets elevated proof burden
- [ ] Dissenting experts cited (if they exist)
- [ ] Methodological critiques of opposing research included
- [ ] Scope of disagreement is accurate (not overstated)
- [ ] Tone in summaries is confident but not dismissive
- [ ] Vulnerabilities in contrarian position acknowledged

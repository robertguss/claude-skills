# Research Question Formulation

How to turn vague gaps into sharp, researchable questions that yield useful results.

---

## The Problem with Vague Questions

**Vague:** "Research productivity systems"

- Too broad—returns generic overview
- No clear endpoint—when is it "done"?
- No focus—which aspect matters?

**Sharp:** "What evidence exists that the Zettelkasten method increases research output compared to traditional note-taking systems?"

- Specific focus (Zettelkasten vs. traditional)
- Clear evidence type sought (comparative evidence)
- Answerable question with endpoint

---

## Anatomy of a Good Research Question

### 1. Specific Subject

Not "productivity" but "the Zettelkasten method"
Not "education" but "phonics-based reading instruction in elementary schools"

### 2. Clear Scope

- Time frame (when?)
- Geography (where?)
- Population (for whom?)
- Context (in what circumstances?)

### 3. Evidence Type Implied

The question suggests what kind of evidence would answer it:

- "What is the effect of X on Y?" → Experimental/Statistical
- "What are examples of X?" → Case Study
- "What do experts think about X?" → Expert Testimony
- "How did X develop?" → Historical

### 4. Answerable

- Can be answered with available evidence
- Has a finite scope
- Doesn't require original research impossible to conduct

### 5. Relevant

- Directly serves the chapter's purpose
- Connects to the book's thesis
- Reader would care about the answer

## Question Types and Formulas

### Existence/Reality Questions

_Does X actually exist/happen?_

**Formula:** "What evidence exists that [phenomenon] occurs in [context]?"

**Examples:**

- "What evidence exists that remote workers experience increased isolation?"
- "What evidence exists that readers retain more from physical books than e-books?"

**Best for:** Validating assumptions, checking if a premise is true.

---

### Prevalence/Scale Questions

_How common/big is X?_

**Formula:** "How widespread is [phenomenon] among [population], and what are the key statistics?"

**Examples:**

- "How widespread is Zettelkasten adoption among academic researchers, and what surveys or data exist?"
- "What percentage of knowledge workers report experiencing information overload?"

**Best for:** Establishing magnitude, showing a problem is significant.

---

### Causal/Mechanism Questions

_Does X cause Y, and how?_

**Formula:** "What evidence supports the claim that [X] causes/leads to [Y], and through what mechanism?"

**Examples:**

- "What evidence supports the claim that handwriting notes improves retention, and through what cognitive mechanism?"
- "What research explains how spaced repetition affects long-term memory formation?"

**Best for:** Understanding why something works, establishing causal claims.

---

### Comparative Questions

_Is X better than Y?_

**Formula:** "What evidence compares [approach A] with [approach B] in terms of [outcome], and what do the findings show?"

**Examples:**

- "What studies compare paper-based note-taking with digital systems in terms of idea generation?"
- "How does the effectiveness of phonics instruction compare to whole-language approaches in reading outcomes?"

**Best for:** Justifying recommendations, supporting "you should do X" claims.

---

### Origin/History Questions

_Where did X come from?_

**Formula:** "What is the historical origin and development of [concept/practice], and who were the key figures?"

**Examples:**

- "What is the historical origin of the commonplace book tradition, and how did it evolve?"
- "Who developed the Getting Things Done methodology and what influenced its design?"

**Best for:** Providing context, establishing credibility of a method.

---

### Expert Consensus Questions

_What do experts think about X?_

**Formula:** "What is the current expert consensus on [topic], and what are the main points of agreement and disagreement?"

**Examples:**

- "What is the current expert consensus on the effectiveness of mindfulness for focus, and where do experts disagree?"
- "What do leading researchers say about the future of knowledge work?"

**Best for:** Establishing authority, showing your view aligns with (or challenges) expert thinking.

---

### Counterargument Questions

_What's the best case against X?_

**Formula:** "What are the strongest arguments and evidence against [claim/approach], and how robust are they?"

**Examples:**

- "What are the strongest criticisms of the Zettelkasten method, and what evidence supports these critiques?"
- "What arguments challenge the claim that deep work is essential for knowledge workers?"

**Best for:** Preparing for objections, demonstrating intellectual honesty.

---

### Application/Implementation Questions

_How do you actually do X?_

**Formula:** "How is [method/approach] implemented in practice, and what examples demonstrate successful application?"

**Examples:**

- "How do professional researchers implement a daily writing practice, and what specific routines do they follow?"
- "What are concrete examples of organizations successfully implementing asynchronous communication?"

**Best for:** Providing practical guidance, moving from theory to practice.

---

### Exception/Boundary Questions

_When does X not apply?_

**Formula:** "Under what conditions does [claim/principle] fail to hold, and what are the boundary conditions?"

**Examples:**

- "Under what conditions does the Zettelkasten method become counterproductive or unnecessary?"
- "When does deep focus work become less important than rapid task-switching?"

**Best for:** Showing nuance, preventing overgeneralization.

## Expanding Architect's Gaps

When the book-architect identifies a gap, expand it:

### Example 1

**Architect's gap:** "Need evidence for Luhmann's productivity"

**Expanded questions:**

1. "What was Niklas Luhmann's publication record (books, articles, papers), and how does it compare to other sociologists of his era?"
2. "What specific statements did Luhmann make attributing his productivity to the Zettelkasten?"
3. "What have scholars who have studied Luhmann's archive concluded about the role of his note system?"

---

### Example 2

**Architect's gap:** "Research on digital vs. paper note-taking"

**Expanded questions:**

1. "What controlled experiments compare retention and comprehension between handwritten and typed notes?"
2. "What neurological research explains differences in cognitive processing between handwriting and typing?"
3. "What studies examine long-term effects (beyond immediate recall) of note-taking medium?"
4. "What are the strongest methodological critiques of the 'handwriting is better' research?"

---

### Example 3

**Architect's gap:** "Examples of successful Zettelkasten users"

**Expanded questions:**

1. "Beyond Luhmann, what documented cases exist of researchers using slip-box or Zettelkasten systems productively?"
2. "What contemporary authors or researchers publicly attribute their output to Zettelkasten-style systems?"
3. "What specific outcomes (publications, discoveries, projects) have been directly linked to Zettelkasten use?"

## Question Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a research question, verify:

- [ ] **Specific:** Subject is clearly defined, not vague
- [ ] **Scoped:** Time, geography, population, context are clear
- [ ] **Evidence-oriented:** Implies what type of evidence would answer it
- [ ] **Answerable:** Can be researched (not requiring impossible data)
- [ ] **Relevant:** Directly serves chapter purpose and book thesis
- [ ] **Standalone:** Can be understood without reading rest of book
- [ ] **Neutral:** Doesn't presuppose the answer
- [ ] **Appropriately sized:** Can be answered meaningfully, not too broad or narrow

---

## Common Mistakes

### Too Broad

❌ "What is productivity?"
✅ "How do researchers define and measure productivity in knowledge work contexts?"

### Too Narrow

❌ "What did Luhmann write on December 14, 1972?"
✅ "What do Luhmann's early cards (1950s-1960s) reveal about how his system evolved?"

### Leading/Biased

❌ "Why is the Zettelkasten the best note-taking system?"
✅ "What evidence supports or challenges claims that Zettelkasten outperforms other note-taking approaches?"

### Unanswerable

❌ "What would Luhmann think of digital tools?"
✅ "How have scholars interpreted Luhmann's principles for application in digital environments?"

### Vague Evidence Target

❌ "Research about note-taking"
✅ "What experimental studies examine the relationship between note-taking method and long-term retention?"

## Splitting Complex Gaps

When a gap is too big for one question, split it:

**Original gap:** "Evidence for the effectiveness of the Zettelkasten method"

**Split into:**

1. Historical evidence (Luhmann's own testimony and output)
2. Theoretical evidence (cognitive science support for the underlying principles)
3. Empirical evidence (studies testing components like linking, spaced review)
4. Comparative evidence (how it performs against alternatives)
5. Practical evidence (case studies of contemporary users)
6. Counter-evidence (critiques and limitations)

Each becomes its own research question and prompt.

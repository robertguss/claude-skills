# Synthesis Best Practices

How to distill large volumes of research into useful, concise summaries that preserve what matters and discard what doesn't.

## The Challenge of Synthesis

Research generates volume. Deep research from Claude and Gemini on multiple gaps can produce dozens of pages per chapter. This raw material is valuable but unwieldy. Synthesis transforms it into something usable.

**Goals of synthesis:**

1. Preserve essential findings
2. Discard irrelevant material
3. Organize for retrieval
4. Enable drafting without re-reading everything
5. Create durable artifacts that carry forward

## What to Keep vs. Discard

### Always Keep

**The "Gold"**

- Evidence that directly supports key arguments
- Specific, named, concrete examples
- Memorable quotes with attribution
- Statistics that quantify claims
- Primary source discoveries

**Critical Context**

- Counterarguments and tensions
- Caveats and limitations
- Surprising findings
- Contradictions between sources

**Practical Utility**

- Quotable material ready for manuscript
- Visual/data opportunities
- Expert names worth citing
- Source information for fact-checking

### Discard or Compress

**Generic Background**

- Information available in any textbook
- Context the reader will already know
- Historical detail beyond what's needed

**Redundancy**

- Multiple sources saying the same thing (keep best, note others exist)
- Repeated findings across research rounds
- Similar examples (keep strongest)

**Tangents**

- Interesting but irrelevant findings
- Deep dives into adjacent topics
- Material for a different chapter

**Noise**

- Weak sources with little to add
- Speculative content without evidence
- Filler that pads without contributing

## Synthesis Process

### Step 1: First Pass — Identification

Read through raw research asking:

- What directly answers the research question?
- What's surprising or important?
- What's quotable or highly specific?
- What challenges the thesis?

Mark or extract these items.

### Step 2: Second Pass — Categorization

Group findings by:

- Evidence type (statistics, case studies, quotes, etc.)
- Strength (strong, adequate, thin)
- Use (definitely use, possibly use, background)

### Step 3: Third Pass — Compression

For each category:

- Lead with the strongest item
- Note that additional support exists
- Compress supporting detail into brief references

**Before compression:**

> "Luhmann published 70 books during his career. His first major work was 'Funktionen und Folgen formaler Organisation' in 1964. He went on to publish 'Trust' in 1968, 'Legitimation durch Verfahren' in 1969, and continued producing roughly two books per year throughout his career. His final work, 'Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft,' was published in 1997, just one year before his death. He also published over 400 articles in academic journals."

**After compression:**

> Luhmann published 70 books and 400+ articles during his academic career—roughly two books per year. His output is well-documented and exceptional compared to peers. [Key sources: Schmidt 2018, Becker 2016]

### Step 4: Fourth Pass — Integration

Connect compressed findings to:

- Chapter purpose
- Book thesis
- Other chapters (note connections)

Add interpretive notes:

- Why this matters
- How it should be used
- What caveats apply

## Compression Techniques

### The "What, So What, Source" Pattern

**What:** [The finding in one sentence]
**So what:** [Why it matters for this chapter]
**Source:** [Citation for verification]

**Example:**

> **What:** Handwriting activates more neural regions than typing (Mueller & Oppenheimer 2014).
> **So what:** Supports the chapter's argument for paper-based note-taking.
> **Source:** "The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard," Psychological Science, peer-reviewed.

### The Evidence Cluster

Group similar findings under one umbrella:

**Instead of:**

- Study 1 found X
- Study 2 found X
- Study 3 found something like X

**Write:**

> Multiple peer-reviewed studies (Mueller & Oppenheimer 2014; James & Engelhardt 2012; Smoker et al. 2009) confirm X. The Mueller study is most frequently cited and has methodological advantages.

### The Qualified Assertion

Combine finding with important caveats:

> Research supports X [main finding], though primarily in [specific context] with [key limitation]. The effect appears strongest for [specific condition].

### The Tension Note

Capture complexity without extended discussion:

> The evidence leans toward X, but Y remains contested. [Expert] argues against; most researchers disagree but acknowledge [specific concern].

## Synthesis Output Structure

### For Individual Gaps (in validation)

```
**Gap:** [ID and question]

**Bottom Line:** [1-2 sentences — the answer to the research question]

**Key Evidence:**
- [Strongest piece with citation]
- [Second strongest with citation]

**Notable:** [Anything surprising, concerning, or particularly useful]

**Caveats:** [Limitations, contested points, thin areas]

**Usable Material:**
- Quote: "[Quote]" — [Attribution]
- Statistic: [Number with source]
- Example: [Named case]
```

### For Chapter Summaries

See `assets/templates/chapter-research-summary-template.md` for full structure. Key synthesis sections:

- **Key Findings:** Distilled answers per gap
- **Strongest Evidence:** The "gold" preserved
- **Quotable Inventory:** Ready-to-use quotes
- **Proof Burden Status:** Claims and their evidence status
- **Thesis Tensions:** Complications and how to handle

### For Final Synthesis

See `assets/templates/final-research-synthesis-template.md`. Book-wide synthesis includes:

- **Thesis Strength Assessment:** Overall evidence base evaluation
- **Cross-Chapter Themes:** Patterns across the book
- **Strongest Assets:** Book-wide "gold"
- **Remaining Vulnerabilities:** Where evidence is thin
- **Consolidated Counterarguments:** All objections mapped

## Preserving Nuance

Compression risks losing important nuance. Preserve complexity by:

### Confidence Flags

Note certainty levels explicitly:

- "Strong evidence supports..."
- "Limited evidence suggests..."
- "Experts disagree about..."
- "The most rigorous study found..."

### Context Markers

Note where findings apply:

- "In academic contexts..."
- "For experienced practitioners..."
- "The US data shows... (international comparison not available)"

### Caveat Preservation

Keep key limitations visible:

- "Sample was primarily college students"
- "Self-reported measures"
- "Pre-2020 research; pandemic may have changed this"

### Dissent Documentation

Note significant disagreement:

- "[Expert] disputes this, arguing..."
- "One study contradicts, but methodological concerns limit its weight"

## Common Synthesis Mistakes

### Over-compression

❌ "Research supports this"
✅ "Three peer-reviewed studies (citations) support this; one study (citation) contradicts but has methodological weaknesses."

### Under-compression

❌ [Three pages of detailed methodology description]
✅ "Multiple studies using varied methodologies converge on this finding."

### Losing the Gold

❌ Generic summary that loses the specific quote/statistic/example
✅ Preserve specific, concrete, usable material explicitly

### Hiding Tensions

❌ "Research confirms X"
✅ "Research leans toward X, though [specific concern] remains. Author should address in Chapter 4."

### Citation Loss

❌ "Studies show..."
✅ "Studies show (Smith 2020; Jones 2021; primary: Luhmann 1981)..."

## Quality Check Questions

Before finalizing synthesis, ask:

1. **Could someone draft the chapter from this summary?**
   - Enough specific material?
   - Clear enough to act on?

2. **Are the strongest pieces preserved?**
   - Best quote still there?
   - Key statistic included?
   - Most compelling example captured?

3. **Are important caveats visible?**
   - Limitations acknowledged?
   - Contradictions noted?
   - Confidence levels clear?

4. **Can sources be found for fact-checking?**
   - Citations complete?
   - Verification flags present?

5. **Is nothing important lost?**
   - Surprising findings preserved?
   - Thesis tensions surfaced?
   - Cross-chapter connections noted?

## The Synthesis Mindset

Think of synthesis as:

- **Curating** not just cutting
- **Prioritizing** not eliminating
- **Clarifying** not simplifying
- **Preserving** the valuable while discarding the redundant

The goal is: _If the raw research disappeared, would this synthesis be enough to write the chapter well?_

_Use these practices when producing Chapter Research Summaries and the Final Research Synthesis._

## How to Use This Log

This log captures significant architectural decisions—choices that shape the book's structure, content, or approach. Each entry records what was decided, why, and what alternatives were considered.

**When to log a decision:**
- Framework or structure choices
- Chapter ordering or sequencing
- What to include or exclude
- How to handle reader objections
- Pacing or weight decisions
- Section boundaries
- Through-line placement
- Any choice you might want to revisit or explain later

**Status definitions:**
- **Active:** Current decision in effect
- **Superseded:** Replaced by a later decision (note which one)
- **Under Review:** Being reconsidered

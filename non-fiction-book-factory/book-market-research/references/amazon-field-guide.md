## Detailed Instructions

### Finding BSR (Best Sellers Rank)

1. Scroll down to **Product Details** section (below the book description)
2. Look for **Best Sellers Rank**
3. You'll see something like: `#12,847 in Kindle Store`
4. Record the overall number (ignore category-specific ranks for now)
5. If multiple formats shown, use the Kindle rank

**What BSR means:**
- Under 10,000 = Strong seller
- 10,000–50,000 = Solid seller
- 50,000–100,000 = Moderate sales
- Over 100,000 = Slow seller

### Finding Prices

1. Look at the **right side** of the product page
2. You'll see format options: Kindle, Paperback, Hardcover, Audiobook
3. Click each format to see its price
4. Record Kindle and Paperback at minimum
5. Note if any format shows "FREE" with Kindle Unlimited

### Finding Review Count and Rating

1. Near the **top of the page**, under the title
2. You'll see stars and a number like: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ 4.3 out of 5 stars · 2,847 ratings
3. **Rating** = the number out of 5 (e.g., 4.3)
4. **Reviews** = the total count (e.g., 2,847)

### Finding Page Count

1. Scroll to **Product Details** section
2. Look for **Print length** or **Pages**
3. Record the number

### Checking Kindle Unlimited Status

Look for any of these indicators:
- "Read for Free" button
- "Kindle Unlimited" badge near the price
- "$0.00" with "Kindle Unlimited" mentioned
- "Free with Kindle Unlimited membership"

Record: **Y** (yes, in KU) or **N** (not in KU)

### Finding Top Category

1. In the **BSR section**, you'll see category rankings
2. Example: `#1 in Personal Productivity` / `#3 in Study Skills`
3. Record the category where the book ranks **highest** (lowest number)
4. This indicates where the book is most competitive

## Tips

- **Open in new tabs**: Open all competitor URLs in separate tabs for faster data entry
- **Use the Kindle page**: BSR is often clearer on the Kindle edition page
- **Ignore audiobook**: Focus on Kindle and print formats
- **Note anomalies**: If something looks unusual (e.g., BSR of 47 for an obscure book), make a note

## Time Estimate

5-8 books typically takes 10-15 minutes to complete.

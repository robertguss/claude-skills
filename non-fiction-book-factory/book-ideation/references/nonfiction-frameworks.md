# Nonfiction Structural Frameworks

Reference for previewing potential book structures during ideation. Full structural decisions belong to `book-architect`—this is for early orientation.

## Framework Overview

| Framework | Best For | Reader Experience |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Problem → Solution | Business, self-help | "I had a problem, now I have a solution" |
| Transformation Arc | Personal development | "I am different now than when I started" |
| Teaching Progression | How-to, technical | "I built capability step by step" |
| Concentric Circles | Philosophy, deep ideas | "I understand this at increasingly profound levels" |
| Case Study Mosaic | Business, psychology | "I see the principle through multiple lenses" |
| Before/During/After | Process-oriented | "I understand the full journey" |
| Myth & Counter-Myth | Contrarian takes | "I've had my assumptions shattered" |
| The Quest | Narrative nonfiction | "I went on a journey with the author" |
| Modular/Reference | Guides, handbooks | "I can find what I need when I need it" |
| Dialectical | Philosophical, analytical | "I held tension and reached synthesis" |

## Framework Details

### Problem → Solution

**Structure:** Define the problem → Explain why it exists → Present the solution → Show implementation

**Works when:** Reader has a clear pain point and wants practical resolution

**Example:** *Getting Things Done* by David Allen

**Key insight:** The problem definition must resonate deeply before the solution feels relevant.

---

### Transformation Arc

**Structure:** Reader's starting state → Catalyst for change → Journey through stages → Arrival at new state

**Works when:** The goal is internal change, not just information transfer

**Example:** *Atomic Habits* by James Clear

**Key insight:** Each chapter should move the reader measurably closer to the end state.

---

### Teaching Progression

**Structure:** Foundations → Building blocks → Integration → Mastery

**Works when:** Skills build on each other; order matters

**Example:** *The Elements of Style* by Strunk & White

**Key insight:** Never introduce a concept before its prerequisites are established.

---

### Concentric Circles

**Structure:** Surface understanding → Deeper layer → Deeper still → Core insight

**Works when:** The idea has depth that rewards repeated examination

**Example:** *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman

**Key insight:** Each circle should feel like a revelation, not repetition.

---

### Case Study Mosaic

**Structure:** Principle → Case 1 → Case 2 → Case 3 → Synthesis

**Works when:** Abstract principles need concrete grounding; diversity of examples strengthens the argument

**Example:** *Good to Great* by Jim Collins

**Key insight:** Cases should differ enough to prove the principle's generality, not just repeat it.

---

### Before/During/After

**Structure:** What happens before (preparation) → What happens during (execution) → What happens after (integration)

**Works when:** The reader faces a discrete event or transition

**Example:** *The First 90 Days* by Michael Watkins

**Key insight:** Most books over-index on "during" and neglect the other phases.

---

### Myth & Counter-Myth

**Structure:** Conventional wisdom → Why it's wrong → The real truth → Implications

**Works when:** You're making a contrarian argument against established beliefs

**Example:** *The 4-Hour Workweek* by Tim Ferriss

**Key insight:** The myth must be genuinely believed by the reader for the counter-myth to land.

---

### The Quest

**Structure:** A journey (literal or metaphorical) that takes both author and reader somewhere

**Works when:** Narrative carries the ideas; the author's experience IS the content

**Example:** *Into the Wild* by Jon Krakauer (narrative nonfiction)

**Key insight:** The reader must want to follow the author; voice and story matter as much as ideas.

---

### Modular/Reference

**Structure:** Self-contained sections organized by topic, usable in any order

**Works when:** Readers will dip in and out; not meant for cover-to-cover reading

**Example:** *The Chicago Manual of Style*

**Key insight:** Navigation and structure are paramount; each module must stand alone.

---

### Dialectical

**Structure:** Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis (possibly repeated at deeper levels)

**Works when:** The topic involves genuine tensions that can't be resolved by picking a side

**Example:** *The Righteous Mind* by Jonathan Haidt

**Key insight:** The synthesis must feel earned, not like a cop-out.

---

## Hybrid Approaches

Most successful nonfiction books combine frameworks:

- **Transformation Arc + Teaching Progression:** Reader changes by learning skills sequentially
- **Problem → Solution + Case Study Mosaic:** Problem defined, solution illustrated through multiple cases
- **Myth & Counter-Myth + Dialectical:** Destroy the myth, acknowledge what it got right, synthesize a better view

## Framework Selection Questions

Ask during ideation to hint at the right structure:

1. Is this primarily about **what to do** (Teaching Progression) or **who to become** (Transformation Arc)?
2. Does the reader have a **specific problem** (Problem → Solution) or a **general curiosity** (Concentric Circles)?
3. Is my argument **contrarian** (Myth & Counter-Myth) or **additive** (Teaching Progression)?
4. Is **narrative** central to the value (The Quest) or secondary (Modular)?
5. Are there **cases/examples** that carry the weight (Case Study Mosaic) or is it **principle-first** (Concentric Circles)?

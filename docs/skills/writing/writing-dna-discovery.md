# Writing DNA Discovery

> Capture a writer's voice DNA through collaborative interview and sample analysis. Use when someone wants to document their writing voice for use with a ghost writer skill. Produces a Voice DNA Document with patterns, anti-patterns, and actionable guidance. Handles one register/mode per session, supports refinement over time.

## Overview

Writing DNA Discovery captures the "genetic code" of your writing voice. Rather than relying on vague descriptions like "conversational" or "professional," this skill systematically analyzes what makes your writing recognizably yours: sentence rhythm patterns, punctuation personality, word choice tendencies, tone temperature, and the relationship you build with readers.

The process combines two approaches. When you provide writing samples, the skill analyzes them for distinctive patterns, identifying the 3-5 characteristics that jump out as uniquely yours. Through collaborative interview, you refine and validate these observations, adding context and surfacing choices you make consciously. The result is a Voice DNA Document that serves as actionable guidance for the Ghost Writer skill.

This is genuine intellectual partnership, not extraction or interrogation. The skill contributes observations, challenges vague answers, and pushes for specificity. But you are the expert on your own voice. The skill helps you articulate and document what you already know instinctively.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- 3-5 writing samples that represent your authentic voice (optional but recommended)
- Clear sense of which register/mode you want to capture (blog, fiction, technical, etc.)
- Time for collaborative conversation (initial sessions typically take 30-60 minutes)

### Basic Usage

**For Initial Discovery:**

```
I want to capture my writing voice. I write blog posts about technology.

Here are some samples:
[Paste 3-5 representative pieces]
```

The skill will analyze your samples, share initial observations, and begin the collaborative interview process.

**For Returning Users:**

```
I want to refine my Voice DNA Document. The ghost writer keeps
using em-dashes too much - I rarely use them.

[Paste current Voice DNA Document]
```

The skill will review your document, incorporate the feedback, and update the relevant sections.

## Features

### Voice Dimension Framework

The skill captures 11+ dimensions of voice, deployed intelligently based on what is most distinctive for your writing:

**Core Dimensions (always explored):**

| Dimension | What It Captures |
|-----------|------------------|
| Sentence Rhythm | Length variation, internal structure, emphasis placement, cadence |
| Punctuation Personality | Em-dashes, semicolons, parentheses, comma density, exclamation points |
| Word Choice | Vocabulary level, Anglo-Saxon vs. Latinate, favorites, avoided words |
| Tone and Temperature | Warm/cool, formal/casual, confident/hedging, measured/enthusiastic |
| Reader Relationship | First person presence, direct address, assumed knowledge, authority stance |

**Extended Dimensions (surfaced as relevant):**

| Dimension | What It Captures |
|-----------|------------------|
| Opening Moves | How you begin pieces: hooks, questions, scene-setting, in media res |
| Closing Moves | How you end: callbacks, questions, definitive statements, quiet landings |
| Structural Patterns | Paragraph construction, transitions, section organization |
| Confidence/Hedging | "Perhaps" vs. direct assertion, qualifier density, uncertainty handling |
| Humor Approach | If present: dry wit, self-deprecation, wordplay, sarcasm, or absent |
| Signature Elements | Distinctive moves, pet phrases, characteristic tics |

**Register-Specific Dimensions:**

- **Fiction**: Narrative distance, dialogue style, description density, interiority access
- **Non-Fiction/Essays**: Argument structure, evidence presentation, concession patterns
- **Blog/Casual**: Hook patterns, personal anecdote integration, call-to-action style
- **Technical**: Instruction structure, example density, assumed reader competence

### Discovery Techniques

Beyond standard Q&A, the skill uses specialized techniques to surface voice:

- **Comparative Choices**: "Would you write 'He walked into the room' or 'He stepped into the room'?"
- **Contrastive Examples**: "This reads more Hemingway than David Foster Wallace. Where are you on that spectrum?"
- **Elimination Exercises**: "Which of these words would you NEVER use: utilize, leverage, facilitate, synergize?"
- **Completion Prompts**: Give a sentence starter; see how you naturally finish it
- **Rewrite Exercises**: Transform generic AI-sounding text into your voice

### Anti-Pattern Capture

What you do not do is as important as what you do. The skill captures:

- Words and phrases you never use
- Structures and tones that would feel "off"
- AI patterns to actively suppress (common tells that would make output sound machine-generated)

### Session Types

| Type | When to Use | Approach |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Initial Discovery | First time capturing your voice | Full discovery flow with samples and interview |
| Sample Addition | Adding new samples to existing profile | Analyze new samples, compare to profile, integrate |
| Dimension Deep-Dive | Want to go deeper on a specific aspect | Focus on single dimension in detail |
| Refinement from Feedback | Ghost writer keeps getting something wrong | Convert feedback into explicit anti-patterns |
| Evolution Update | Writing style has changed over time | Compare old vs. new samples, update profile |
| New Register | Capturing voice for different context | New discovery for different mode |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Start

**For New Users:**
1. Identify the register/mode to capture (blog, fiction, technical, etc.)
2. Share writing samples if available
3. Clarify the goal (general capture vs. specific project)
4. Discuss influences or writers you identify with

**For Returning Users:**
1. Provide current Voice DNA Document
2. Review what is developed vs. needs depth
3. Clarify what brings you back (new samples, feedback, evolution, deep dive)
4. Focus on specific areas to address

### Phase 2: Analysis and Interview

When you provide samples, the skill:

1. **Initial Scan**: Reads samples and identifies the 3-5 most distinctive patterns
2. **Shares Observations**: Presents findings with specific examples from your text
3. **Dialogue and Refinement**: You confirm, adjust, or add context
4. **Probes Deeper**: Asks targeted questions based on what emerged
5. **Synthesizes**: Updates the DNA document at meaningful milestones

The skill maintains these behaviors throughout:
- **One question at a time**: Never overwhelms with multiple questions
- **Proactive observations with reasoning**: Explains why patterns matter
- **Contradiction flagging**: Surfaces inconsistencies for clarification
- **Gap identification**: Notes dimensions that need more exploration

### Phase 3: End

1. **Summary**: Current state of the profile, what is developed vs. needs depth
2. **Readiness Assessment**: Where the profile sits on the readiness scale
3. **Next Steps**: What to tackle next time, or signal readiness for ghost writer
4. **Overnight Question**: Something to notice before next session

Example overnight question:
> "Between now and next time, notice a piece of writing - yours or someone else's - that makes you think 'that is exactly how I would/wouldn't say that.' Bring it back."

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Writing samples | Recommended | 3-5 pieces representing your authentic voice |
| Register/mode | Required | Blog, fiction, technical, newsletter, etc. |
| Existing DNA document | For return sessions | Current Voice DNA Document to refine |
| Feedback | For refinement sessions | What the ghost writer gets wrong |

### Outputs

**Voice DNA Document** containing:

- **Quick Reference**: Core temperature, sentence signature, distinctive moves, never-dos
- **Voice Profile**: Dimension-by-dimension analysis with status indicators and examples
- **Exemplar Passages**: Annotated excerpts demonstrating patterns in action
- **Anti-Patterns**: What to avoid with reasoning, including AI patterns to suppress
- **Ghost Writer Briefing**: Do This, Don't Do This, When Uncertain rules
- **Profile Metadata**: Readiness level, confidence assessment per dimension, gaps
- **Session History**: Record of discovery sessions for continuity

## Best Practices

### Sample Selection

- Choose writing you are proud of, not heavily edited pieces
- Include variety: different topics, moods, lengths
- Avoid collaborative or ghostwritten work unless you can identify your contributions
- Select pieces that feel most "you," even if they break conventional rules

### During Discovery

- Push back when observations do not feel right: "Actually, that was unusual for me"
- Provide context: "I was trying something different in that piece"
- Be honest about aspirational vs. actual voice
- Share what you consciously avoid and why

### Document Maintenance

- Return for refinement when ghost writer output reveals gaps
- Update after significant shifts in your writing practice
- Create separate documents for genuinely different registers
- Version the document when significant changes occur

### Readiness Assessment

Do not stop too early. Minimum Viable readiness requires:

- [ ] At least 3-5 strong patterns identified with examples
- [ ] Clear sense of tone/emotional temperature
- [ ] Key anti-patterns documented
- [ ] Your validation ("yes, that is me")

Solid readiness adds:

- [ ] Multiple dimensions developed with confidence
- [ ] Exemplar passages annotated
- [ ] Ghost Writer Briefing section complete
- [ ] Anti-patterns with reasoning
- [ ] Stress-tested against your instincts

## Integration

### Pipeline Position

Writing DNA Discovery is the upstream skill in the Writing Pipeline. It produces the Voice DNA Document that Ghost Writer consumes.

```
Writing DNA Discovery --> Voice DNA Document --> Ghost Writer --> Drafts
```

### Upstream Skills

None required. Writing DNA Discovery is typically the entry point to the writing pipeline.

### Downstream Skills

- **Ghost Writer**: Consumes the Voice DNA Document to generate drafts

### Cross-Pipeline Integration

- Voice DNA Documents can inform any writing task, not just Ghost Writer
- The document serves as reference for manual writing and editing
- Patterns can guide feedback to human editors or collaborators

## Examples

### Example 1: Initial Discovery Session

**User Input:**
```
I write a newsletter about product management. Here are three recent issues:

[Sample 1: 800-word essay on roadmapping]
[Sample 2: 600-word piece on stakeholder communication]
[Sample 3: 1000-word deep dive on metrics]
```

**Skill Response:**
> Here is what I am noticing about your writing:
>
> **Sentence Rhythm**: You favor short, punchy sentences (8-12 words) punctuated by occasional longer explanatory sentences (20-25 words). The short sentences carry your main points; the longer ones provide context. Example from your roadmapping piece: "Roadmaps are not plans. They're communication tools."
>
> **Punctuation**: Heavy em-dash user. You deploy them for dramatic pauses rather than parenthetical insertions. I count 12 em-dashes across these three pieces, always singles, never pairs.
>
> **Opening Pattern**: You start with a bold claim that challenges conventional wisdom. All three pieces open with a provocative statement: "Roadmaps are lies," "Your stakeholders don't care about your features," "Most metrics meetings are theater."
>
> Before I continue: Does this feel accurate? And that opening pattern - is it intentional or something you do naturally?

### Example 2: Refinement from Feedback

**User Input:**
```
The ghost writer keeps adding phrases like "It's important to note" and
"In today's fast-paced environment." I would never write those.

[Existing DNA Document]
```

**Skill Response:**
> Got it. These are classic AI patterns that definitely don't fit your voice. Let me add them to your Anti-Patterns section:
>
> **AI Patterns to Suppress** (updated):
> - "It's important to note/remember" - hedging phrase; you assert directly
> - "In today's [adjective] [noun]" - throat-clearing; you start with substance
> - "As we navigate..." - corporate-speak; you use plain language
>
> I've also added these to your "Don't Do This" list in the Ghost Writer Briefing.
>
> Are there other phrases from recent ghost writer output that felt wrong? I want to make sure we catch the full pattern.

### Example 3: New Register

**User Input:**
```
I have my blog voice captured. Now I want to capture my fiction voice -
I'm working on a mystery novel.

[Existing blog Voice DNA Document]
```

**Skill Response:**
> Fiction is a different register, so we'll create a separate Voice DNA Document for your mystery writing. Your blog voice may or may not transfer - we'll discover that together.
>
> Do you have fiction samples to share? Even drafts or fragments would help. And tell me about your fiction influences - which mystery writers do you admire, and which do you want to sound nothing like?

## Reference Files

The skill can load these references as needed during discovery:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `references/anti-ai-patterns.md` | Common AI tells to suppress |
| `references/voice-dimension-catalog.md` | Deep exploration of each dimension |
| `references/interview-question-bank.md` | Structured discovery questions |
| `references/sample-analysis-guide.md` | Systematic sample analysis approach |
| `references/dna-document-examples.md` | Examples of well-developed profiles |
| `references/failure-patterns.md` | Signs that a profile is weak |

## Edge Cases

### Aspirational vs. Actual Voice

If there is a gap between how you describe your ideal voice and what appears in samples:
> "I'm noticing a gap between how you describe your ideal voice and what I see in these samples. Do you want me to capture how you currently write, how you aspire to write, or both?"

The document can capture both, noting which is which.

### Limited Samples

With only one short piece:
- Acknowledge lower confidence
- Lean more heavily on interview
- Note which patterns are confirmed vs. tentative
- Flag dimensions that need more sample data

### Inconsistent Samples

If samples show conflicting patterns:
- Is this multiple registers? (Capture separately)
- Is this evolution? (Capture current preference)
- Is this situational? (Document when each applies)

### Edited/Collaborative Work

If samples may have been edited by others:
- Ask about editorial involvement
- Focus on patterns you confirm as "yours"
- Note uncertainty where relevant

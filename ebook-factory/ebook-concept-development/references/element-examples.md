# Element Examples

Good and bad examples for each core element. Use to calibrate quality and push for specificity.

---

## Reader

### Weak Examples

**Too broad:**

> "Entrepreneurs who want to grow their business"

_Problem: This is a category, not a person. Can't make decisions about what to include/exclude._

**Demographics only:**

> "Women aged 25-40 who work in tech"

_Problem: Demographics don't reveal problems, struggles, or what they've tried._

**Wishful thinking:**

> "Anyone who wants to be more productive"

_Problem: "Anyone" means no one. No specific situation or pain point._

### Strong Examples

**Specific situation:**

> "First-time founders in their first 18 months who are drowning in advice. They've read the startup books, listened to the podcasts, but have too many frameworks and not enough clarity on what to actually do Monday morning. They're overwhelmed, not uninformed."

_Why it works: Specific stage, specific problem (overwhelm from too much, not too little), implies what they've tried._

**Clear pain point:**

> "Mid-career professionals who've been promoted into management but never learned how to give feedback. They avoid hard conversations, their team's performance suffers, and they're starting to wonder if they're cut out for leadership."

_Why it works: Specific transition point, specific skill gap, emotional stakes clear._

**Identifiable person:**

> "The person who bought three productivity apps last month, set them up with enthusiasm, and abandoned all of them within two weeks. They don't need another system — they need to understand why systems keep failing them."

_Why it works: You can picture this person. You probably know them. The problem is specific and behavioral._

## Transformation

### Weak Examples

**Vague improvement:**

> "Before: Unproductive. After: Productive."

_Problem: These aren't states you can picture. No concrete difference._

**Too ambitious:**

> "Before: Struggling writer. After: Bestselling author."

_Problem: An ebook can't deliver this. Overpromises._

**Just information transfer:**

> "Before: Doesn't know about X. After: Knows about X."

_Problem: Knowledge isn't transformation. What can they DO differently?_

### Strong Examples

**Concrete behavior change:**

> "Before: Stares at blank page, writes in painful bursts, rarely finishes anything.  
> After: Sits down with a clear process, writes consistently for 30 minutes, completes drafts."

_Why it works: You can observe the before and after. Specific behaviors, not vague states._

**Mindset shift with evidence:**

> "Before: Believes they're 'not a math person' and avoids anything quantitative.  
> After: Comfortable with basic data analysis, actually enjoys finding insights in numbers, no longer opts out of quantitative conversations."

_Why it works: Internal shift (belief) paired with external evidence (behavior change)._

**Specific capability:**

> "Before: Has ideas for YouTube videos but no idea how to structure them — rambles, loses viewers.  
> After: Can outline a video in 15 minutes using a proven structure that hooks and holds attention."

_Why it works: Specific skill, specific time frame, clear before/after observable states._

## Promise

### Weak Examples

**Vague benefit:**

> "Learn to be more effective"

_Problem: "More effective" at what? Says nothing specific._

**Feature-focused:**

> "A complete guide to email marketing"

_Problem: Describes what the ebook IS, not what the reader GETS._

**Overpromising:**

> "Transform your entire life in one weekend"

_Problem: Unbelievable. Triggers skepticism._

### Strong Examples

**Specific outcome:**

> "Write your first Zettelkasten note today and never lose a good idea again."

_Why it works: Specific action ("write your first note"), specific timeline ("today"), specific benefit ("never lose a good idea")._

**Problem → solution:**

> "Stop drowning in bookmarks you'll never revisit — build a personal knowledge system that actually resurfaces what you need, when you need it."

_Why it works: Names the pain precisely, promises a specific solution._

**Transformation in a sentence:**

> "Go from 'I should post more' to a sustainable content system that runs on 3 hours a week."

_Why it works: Captures the before/after in one line. Specific and believable ("3 hours a week")._

## Content Source

### Weak Examples

**Vague reference:**

> "Based on my experience"

_Problem: What experience? How validated? What specifically exists?_

**Assumed from nothing:**

> "I'll write it all from scratch based on what I know"

_Problem: May work, but no validation that the content resonates. Higher risk._

### Strong Examples

**Validated content:**

> "Based on my 12-part YouTube series on Zettelkasten (47K total views). The 'numbering system' video (8K views) generated 200+ comments asking for more detail — that's the core of this ebook."

_Why it works: Specific content identified, audience validation (views, comments), clear signal about what resonates._

**Content inventory:**

> "I have: (1) A newsletter series on feedback conversations (6 issues, 45% avg open rate), (2) A workshop I've run 4 times with 50+ participants, (3) The slide deck and exercises from that workshop. Gaps: Need to write the 'difficult personalities' chapter from scratch."

_Why it works: Specific inventory, validation signals (open rate, repeat workshop), gaps identified._

**Book extraction:**

> "Extracting the 'Morning Routine' section from my larger book project. It's 3 chapters (roughly 8,000 words already drafted) that stand alone. The full book won't be ready for 8 months, but this section is complete enough to validate interest."

_Why it works: Clear source, content already exists, strategic rationale for extraction._

---

## Scope & Format

### Weak Examples

**Undefined:**

> "However long it needs to be"

_Problem: No constraint means no discipline. Will likely bloat or meander._

**Format without rationale:**

> "It'll be a workbook"

_Problem: Why a workbook? Does the content actually fit that format?_

**Everything included:**

> "Covers the complete history, theory, and practice of X"

_Problem: This is a book, not an ebook. Scope too broad._

### Strong Examples

**Tight scope:**

> "12,000-15,000 words. 6 chapters focused ONLY on the daily capture process — not organization, not retrieval, not the full system. Someone finishing this will have a working capture habit, nothing more."

_Why it works: Word count range, chapter count, explicit boundary ("ONLY"), clear outcome._

**Format with rationale:**

> "Prose chapters with one 'Try This' exercise per chapter. Not a full workbook because the transformation is mostly understanding, with light application. Exercises are for reinforcement, not the main event."

_Why it works: Format chosen deliberately, rationale for what it's NOT._

**Platform-aware:**

> "KDP primary (for discoverability), priced at $4.99. Short enough to read in one sitting (under 2 hours). No companion files needed — everything works within the ebook itself."

_Why it works: Platform choice explained, reading time considered, delivery constraints clear._

---

## Value Gap (Situational)

### Weak Examples

**Just reorganization:**

> "It's my YouTube content in written form"

_Problem: Why would someone pay for content they can watch free? Format change isn't enough._

**Vague addition:**

> "Goes deeper than my free content"

_Problem: Deeper how? This needs to be specific._

### Strong Examples

**Clear additional value:**

> "My YouTube videos show WHAT to do. This ebook explains WHY it works and HOW to troubleshoot when it doesn't. Viewers who've tried and struggled need the context I didn't have time to include in video format."

_Why it works: Specific gap (what vs. why/how), identifies who needs it (viewers who've tried and struggled)._

**Reference value:**

> "The video is 45 minutes of teaching. The ebook is the permanent reference — checklists, templates, and quick-lookup guides you can use while implementing. Watch once, reference forever."

_Why it works: Different use case (learning vs. reference), clear ongoing value._

---

## Enemy (Situational)

### Weak Examples

**Vague opponent:**

> "Bad advice out there"

_Problem: Too vague. What bad advice? From whom?_

**Strawman:**

> "People who don't care about quality"

_Problem: No one self-identifies this way. Not a real enemy._

### Strong Examples

**Specific conventional wisdom:**

> "The enemy is 'write every day' advice. It sounds virtuous but creates guilt spirals for people with unpredictable schedules. This ebook argues for 'write consistently' instead — which might mean 3x/week, and that's fine."

_Why it works: Names specific advice, explains why it's harmful, offers clear alternative._

**Named mindset:**

> "The enemy is 'productivity porn' — the endless consumption of systems, tools, and tips that feels productive but produces nothing. This ebook is the antidote: one simple system, no optimization rabbit holes."

_Why it works: Named and recognizable pattern, reader can identify if this is them, clear positioning against it._

## Using These Examples

During concept development:

1. **Compare drafts to examples** — Is the Reader closer to weak or strong?
2. **Push for specificity** — "Can we make this more like [strong example]?"
3. **Name the problem** — "This is feature-focused, not benefit-focused. What does the reader GET?"
4. **Calibrate ambition** — "Is this transformation achievable in ebook scope?"

## Format Red Flags

**Mismatch warning signs:**

- Choosing workbook but content is mostly conceptual
- Choosing prose but content is really a process
- Choosing templates but templates aren't genuinely reusable
- Choosing case studies but only have 1-2 weak examples
- Choosing FAQ but questions feel forced

**The test:** Would a reader feel cheated if they expected this format and got your content? If there's any doubt, reconsider.

## Why This Path Is Harder

**Content Audit path:**

- Material exists externally
- Patterns are visible
- Validation signals may exist
- The work is about _seeing_ what's there

**Expertise Extraction path:**

- Material exists only in the user's head
- Claude must extract through conversation
- No validation signals yet
- The work is about _surfacing_ what's hidden

This path requires:

- More active questioning
- Recognition of expertise indicators
- Building user confidence
- Finding ebook shape in formless knowledge

## Psychology of Expertise Blindness

### The Curse of Knowledge

Experts can't remember what it was like not to know. What feels "obvious" to them is often the exact thing that would be valuable to teach.

**Signs of the curse:**

- "Everyone knows this"
- "It's just common sense"
- "There's nothing special about what I do"
- Skipping foundational steps when explaining

**How to address it:**

- Ask them to explain as if to a complete beginner
- Point out when they skip steps: "You jumped from A to D—what's B and C?"
- Use contrast: "How would someone without your experience approach this?"

### Tacit vs. Explicit Knowledge

Much expertise is _tacit_—knowledge that's hard to articulate because it's embedded in intuition and practice.

**Signs of tacit knowledge:**

- "I just know when it's right"
- "It's hard to explain, I just do it"
- "You develop a feel for it"
- Difficulty breaking down their process

**How to surface it:**

- Ask about specific decisions: "Walk me through the last time you did this"
- Focus on exceptions: "What do you do when the normal approach doesn't work?"
- Ask about mistakes: "What errors do beginners make that you've learned to avoid?"

### Imposter Syndrome

Even genuine experts often dismiss their expertise.

**Signs:**

- "I'm still learning"
- "There are people who know way more than me"
- "I'm not really an expert"
- Deflecting compliments about expertise

**How to address it:**

- Use external evidence: "What do people come to you for?"
- Normalize the feeling: "Most experts feel this way"
- Focus on relative advantage: "Compared to someone starting out..."

## Expertise Indicators to Listen For

Phrases that signal hidden value—when you hear these, dig deeper:

### Direct Indicators

- "I always tell people..."
- "The thing most people don't realize..."
- "I've figured out a way to..."
- "Everyone overcomplicates this..."
- "I wish someone had told me..."
- "After doing this for X years, I've learned..."

### Frustration Indicators

- "It drives me crazy when people say..."
- "I hate how everyone thinks..."
- "People keep making the same mistake..."
- "Why doesn't anyone talk about..."

### Casual Expertise Indicators

- Explaining something complex simply (without realizing it's complex)
- Skipping steps in explanations (tacit knowledge)
- Using specialized vocabulary naturally
- Having strong opinions about how something "should" be done

### Experience Indicators

- Stories of failure and recovery
- Evolution of their thinking over time
- Specific examples from their work
- Refinements to standard approaches

## Testing Differentiation

Not all expertise is ebook-worthy. Test for genuine differentiation:

### The "Why You?" Test

- What makes YOUR take on this different?
- Who else teaches this, and how are you different?
- What do you do that others don't?
- What have you figured out through experience that isn't in the books?

### The "Would They Pay?" Test

- Would someone pay $15-20 for this knowledge?
- What's the cost of NOT knowing this?
- What outcome does this expertise produce?
- Is this nice-to-know or need-to-know?

### The "Google Test"

- Can someone get this from a quick Google search?
- What do you know that's NOT in the first page of results?
- What's missing from the existing resources?
- What would YOUR ebook add?

### The "Specificity Test"

- Is this general knowledge or specific expertise?
- Can you point to concrete examples and outcomes?
- Is this theoretical or battle-tested?
- How refined is the process/framework?

## From Expertise to Ebook Shape

Expertise is formless. Ebooks need shape. Here's how to find it:

### Find the Slice

Expertise is often too broad. Find the specific slice:

- Not "everything about X" but "the one thing about X that matters most"
- Not "how to do X" but "how to do X when Y"
- Not your full expertise but the part with clearest transformation

**Questions to find the slice:**

- If you could only teach ONE thing, what would it be?
- What's the smallest piece that would make the biggest difference?
- Where does most of the value come from?

### Find the Transformation

Expertise alone isn't an ebook. The reader needs a journey:

- **Before:** Where is the reader now? What do they believe, do, struggle with?
- **After:** Where will they be? What changes?
- **The bridge:** What expertise gets them from before to after?

**Questions to find the transformation:**

- What can they DO after learning this?
- How does their behavior change?
- What problem goes away?
- What opportunity opens up?

### Find the Reader

Expertise needs a specific reader:

- Who would benefit MOST from this?
- Who is ready for this (not too beginner, not too advanced)?
- Who would pay for this?
- Who can you picture reading it?

**Questions to find the reader:**

- Who do you most want to help?
- Who asks you these questions?
- Who struggles with this the most?

## Building User Confidence

Users often need help believing their expertise is valuable.

### Reframe "Obvious" as "Valuable"

"What feels obvious to you after years of experience is exactly what someone starting out needs to learn. Your 'obvious' is their 'revelation.'"

### Use External Evidence

- "What do people come to you for advice on?"
- "What have people thanked you for explaining?"
- "What do colleagues ask you to help with?"

### The "Younger Self" Frame

"If you could go back and tell your younger self one thing, what would it be? That's probably an ebook."

### The "Time Saved" Frame

"If this ebook could save someone 6 months of figuring it out themselves, what would be in it?"

### Normalize the Feeling

"Most experts feel like their knowledge isn't special. That's actually a sign of real expertise—you've internalized it so deeply it feels normal."

## Audience Analysis Without Metrics

When there's no content to analyze, audience signals must come from elsewhere:

### Direct Experience

- Who asks you questions in professional settings?
- Who seeks you out for advice?
- What types of people struggle with what you know?
- Who have you helped in the past?

### Analogous Audiences

- Who buys similar ebooks?
- What adjacent problems do people pay to solve?
- What communities exist around this topic?
- Where do people go to learn this now?

### The "Who Struggles?" Method

- Who finds this hard that you find easy?
- At what stage do people commonly get stuck?
- What level of experience benefits most from this knowledge?
- Who is ready for this information vs. not ready?

### Building an Audience Profile Without Data

Even without metrics, describe:

- Their situation (job, life stage, problem context)
- Their current struggles
- What they've already tried
- Why they haven't succeeded yet
- What would make them trust you

This profile guides the ebook even without validation data. The ebook itself can become the validation.

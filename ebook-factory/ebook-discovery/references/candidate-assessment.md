## Viability Criteria

A viable ebook candidate should pass these checks:

### Core Viability

| Criterion          | Question                                | Green Flag                       | Red Flag                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Clear idea**     | Can you state it in 1-2 sentences?      | Crisp, specific statement        | Rambling, vague, or requires paragraphs    |
| **Reader exists**  | Who specifically wants this?            | Can describe a real person       | "Everyone" or too abstract                 |
| **Transformation** | What changes for the reader?            | Concrete before/after            | Vague improvement or just "more knowledge" |
| **Author fit**     | Why is this person the one to write it? | Unique experience or perspective | Anyone could write it                      |
| **Ebook fit**      | Is this genuinely ebook-sized?          | Natural scope of 10-25K words    | Too thin or too thick                      |

### Secondary Viability

| Criterion       | Question                                     | Consideration                                             |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Effort**      | How much work to create this?                | Factor in existing content vs. creation from scratch      |
| **Timeliness**  | Is there a moment for this?                  | Timely topics move faster but may have shorter shelf life |
| **Competition** | What else exists?                            | Crowded spaces need clear differentiation                 |
| **Energy**      | Does the author actually want to write this? | Low energy = low completion probability                   |

## The Ebook-Shaped Test

### Too Thin (Blog Post Territory)

**Warning signs:**

- Transformation can be stated AND delivered in 1-2 paragraphs
- Only 2-3 points to make
- Could be fully covered in a single article
- Stretching to fill pages would mean padding
- Less than 8,000 words seems natural

**The test:**
"If you started writing this, would you run out of things to say before hitting 10,000 words?"

**What to do:**

- Kill as ebook candidate, suggest blog post or article
- OR find the bigger context this fits into
- OR bundle with related ideas

### Too Thick (Full Book Territory)

**Warning signs:**

- Transformation requires multiple sequential stages
- Naturally breaks into 5+ distinct parts, each substantial
- Could easily be 50,000+ words
- Cutting scope feels like losing essential content
- Readers would need months to implement

**The test:**
"Could someone realistically achieve this transformation from an ebook, or does this require book-length treatment?"

**What to do:**

- Kill as ebook candidate, suggest full book development
- OR extract a subset that stands alone
- OR split into series of ebooks

### Ebook-Shaped (Just Right)

**Indicators:**

- Naturally 10,000-25,000 words
- 4-8 chapters feels right
- Single, focused transformation
- Could be read in 1-3 sessions
- Delivers clear value without padding or rushing

**The test:**
"Does this have enough substance to justify $9.99-$19.99 but not so much that it becomes a slog?"

## Example Candidates

### Strong Candidates

**Example 1: The Specific Process**

> "A guide to writing YouTube video scripts that hook viewers in the first 5 seconds. Based on my analysis of 200+ videos and what I've learned writing scripts for my 50K-subscriber channel."

**Why it's strong:**

- Specific transformation (hooking viewers in 5 seconds)
- Clear expertise backing (200+ videos analyzed, real channel)
- Ebook-sized (focused on one skill)
- Validation potential (existing audience)

**Example 2: The Hard-Won Lesson**

> "What I learned from losing $50K to a business partner and how to structure partnerships that protect you. Includes the exact contract clauses I now use."

**Why it's strong:**

- Genuine expertise (paid for with real experience)
- Clear reader (people entering partnerships)
- Specific outcome (protection)
- Unique value (actual contract clauses)

**Example 3: The Translation Bridge**

> "Explaining technical debt to non-technical executives: How to get buy-in for necessary refactoring work without using jargon."

**Why it's strong:**

- Clear two-audience bridge
- Specific problem (getting buy-in)
- Ebook-sized (one type of communication)
- Practitioner expertise implied

### Weak Candidates

**Example 1: The Vague Topic**

> "A guide to being more productive."

**Why it's weak:**

- No specific transformation
- Massively overcrowded space
- Too broad (productivity how? for whom? in what context?)
- No unique angle apparent

**Fix path:** Find the specific slice. "Productivity for remote software developers with ADHD" is much stronger.

**Example 2: The Thin Insight**

> "Why you should use a standing desk."

**Why it's weak:**

- Could be a blog post
- Single insight, not enough for ebook
- No transformation beyond the purchase decision

**Fix path:** Kill as ebook. Make it a blog post, or find the broader system it fits into.

**Example 3: The Disguised Book**

> "A complete guide to starting and running a successful podcast, from idea to monetization."

**Why it's weak:**

- Too broad for ebook format
- Multiple sequential transformations (starting → producing → growing → monetizing)
- Each section could be its own ebook

**Fix path:** Extract one section. "How to launch your first 10 podcast episodes" is ebook-sized.

**Example 4: The Repackage Without Value**

> "A collection of my best blog posts about writing."

**Why it's weak:**

- No transformation beyond access
- No value gap from free content
- Readers can already get this for free

**Fix path:** If pursuing this path, need significant new value: synthesis, framework, new content, updated perspectives.

## Validation Signals

### Strong Signals

| Signal                  | What It Means                            | How to Use                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Repeat questions        | People actively want this                | Note frequency and specificity   |
| High engagement content | Topic resonates                          | Track which specific angles work |
| Direct requests         | "You should write a book about..."       | Capture exact phrasing           |
| Paid for related        | People bought courses/consulting on this | Validates willingness to pay     |
| Problem conversations   | People bring this up unprompted          | Pattern indicates pain point     |

### Moderate Signals

| Signal                      | What It Means           | Limitations                |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| High views/reads            | Interest exists         | Interest ≠ purchase intent |
| Social shares               | Resonance with audience | Sharing ≠ buying           |
| Newsletter signups on topic | Dedicated interest      | Free ≠ paid                |
| Comments on posts           | Engagement              | May not represent buyers   |

### Weak or False Signals

| Signal                       | Why It's Weak                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Friends say it's a good idea | Politeness, not market validation |
| You find it interesting      | Author interest ≠ reader demand   |
| "No one else is doing this"  | Might mean no demand exists       |
| Competitor success           | Doesn't mean there's room for you |

### No Validation Yet

For expertise-based candidates without content history:

- Look for analogous signals (similar ebooks that have sold)
- Note professional context (do clients ask about this?)
- Consider the "would they pay?" test
- The ebook itself may become the validation

---

## Validation Experiments

Before committing to an ebook, consider testing interest:

### Low-Effort Tests

**Newsletter poll:**
"I'm considering writing an ebook on [topic]. Would this interest you?"

- Quick signal
- Biased toward yes (people want to be supportive)

**Blog post test:**
Write a substantial post on the topic, measure engagement vs. baseline

- Real behavior signal
- Doesn't test purchase intent

**Social media thread:**
Share key insights from the potential ebook, track response

- Quick feedback
- Platform-dependent engagement

### Medium-Effort Tests

**Landing page:**
Create a simple page describing the ebook, collect email signups

- Tests enough interest to take action
- Doesn't test payment

**Waitlist with price:**
"Sign up to be notified when [ebook] launches at [$X]"

- Closer to purchase intent
- Still not actual payment

### Higher-Effort Tests

**Pre-sale:**
Offer pre-orders at a discount before the ebook exists

- Real purchase intent signal
- Requires confidence and commitment

**Workshop test:**
Teach the content live, gauge response and refine

- Tests content quality
- Different format, but validates ideas

## Matching Candidates to Intent

The user's intent affects which candidates to prioritize:

### Income Intent

**Prioritize:**

**Deprioritize:**

- "Should" ideas with no energy
- Market-optimized but boring candidates
- (Less filtering needed—passion is the filter)

## Using Questions Effectively

**One at a time:** Never barrage with multiple questions. Ask one, listen, follow up.

**Listen for signals:** The answer often contains the next question. Follow the energy.

**Go deeper:** Surface answers need follow-up. "Tell me more about that." "What specifically?"

**Circle back:** Early answers often become relevant later. "Earlier you mentioned... how does that connect?"

**Productive silence:** After asking, wait. Don't rush to fill silence.

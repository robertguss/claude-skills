## Prioritization Framework

When facing multiple candidates:

### Step 1: Quick Filter

Eliminate candidates that:

- Are clearly too thin or too thick
- Have no path to transformation
- Author has no energy for
- Contradict the author's intent

### Step 2: Score Remaining Candidates

For each candidate, rate (High/Med/Low):

| Factor          | Candidate A | Candidate B | Candidate C |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Validation      |             |             |             |
| Effort          |             |             |             |
| Timeliness      |             |             |             |
| Strategic Value |             |             |             |
| Energy          |             |             |             |

### Step 3: Weight by Intent

Based on user's stated intent, which factors matter most?

| Intent           | Primary Factors             | Secondary Factors |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Income           | Validation, Effort          | Timeliness        |
| Authority        | Strategic Value, Validation | Energy            |
| Audience Service | Validation, Energy          | Effort            |
| Lead Generation  | Strategic Value, Validation | Effort            |
| Passion          | Energy, Strategic Value     | Effort            |

### Step 4: Make a Recommendation

Present the recommendation with reasoning:

"Based on your [intent] goal, I'd recommend starting with [Candidate X]. Here's why:

- [Primary factor]: [Specific reasoning]
- [Secondary factor]: [Specific reasoning]

[Candidate Y] is a close second, and might be better if [condition].

What's your reaction to this?"

## Trade-off Scenarios

Common prioritization dilemmas:

### High Validation vs. Low Energy

**Situation:** One candidate has strong demand signals but author isn't excited. Another has high energy but uncertain demand.

**Considerations:**

- Low-energy projects often stall
- High-demand projects can build energy through feedback
- First ebook completion matters more than optimization

**Recommendation pathway:**

- If author has never completed an ebook: prioritize energy
- If author has completion track record: prioritize validation
- If income is critical: prioritize validation with energy check ("Can you muster enough energy to finish this?")

### Obvious Winner vs. Unexplored Territory

**Situation:** One candidate is clearly the strongest by objective measures. But an unexplored mode might surface something better.

**Considerations:**

- Diminishing returns on exploration
- Opportunity cost of not starting
- Strong candidates don't get weaker while you explore

**Recommendation pathway:**

- If current candidate is 8+/10: Start development, note other modes for future
- If current candidate is 6-7/10: Quick scan of most promising unexplored mode
- If current candidate is <6/10: More exploration warranted

### Timely vs. Evergreen

**Situation:** One candidate is timely but window is limited. Another is evergreen but less urgent.

**Considerations:**

- Timely ebooks can ride waves but risk missing the window
- Evergreen ebooks have longer runways but less urgency
- Author's ability to execute quickly

**Recommendation pathway:**

- If author can execute in [window]: Prioritize timely
- If execution speed is uncertain: Prioritize evergreen
- If both matter: Can the evergreen one wait? Start with timely.

### Easy Win vs. Significant Work

**Situation:** One candidate is quick to create (high existing content). Another is stronger but requires significant new creation.

**Considerations:**

- Quick wins build momentum
- First ebook teaches the process
- Significant work can stall without experience

**Recommendation pathway:**

- If first ebook: Prioritize the quick win
- If experienced: Prioritize the stronger idea
- If time-constrained: Prioritize quick win regardless

## Timeliness Assessment

### What Makes Something Timely?

**Trend-aligned:**

- Riding a current wave of interest
- Connected to something in the zeitgeist
- Keyword search volume increasing

**Event-driven:**

- Connected to upcoming event, release, or moment
- Seasonal relevance
- Response to something that just happened

**Window-limited:**

- Opportunity that will close
- First-mover advantage available
- Competition hasn't saturated yet

### How Long Do Moments Last?

| Type                  | Typical Window      | Examples                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Breaking news         | Days to weeks       | Response to major event       |
| Trending topic        | Weeks to months     | Current cultural conversation |
| Emerging practice     | Months to 1-2 years | New technology, methodology   |
| Generational shift    | Years               | Changing workplace norms      |
| Evergreen with timing | Variable            | Tax season, back-to-school    |

### Timeliness Red Flags

- The wave has already crested
- Too many competitors have already published
- The moment requires faster execution than possible
- Chasing trends outside expertise zone

### When to Prioritize Timeliness

- Author can execute quickly
- Topic genuinely aligns with expertise
- Window is real, not imagined
- Even if moment passes, content has residual value

## Matching to Intent

Detailed matching guidance (supplements `candidate-assessment.md`):

### Income Intent

**Prioritize:**

1. Strongest validation signals
2. Lowest effort for acceptable quality
3. Topics with proven buyer willingness
4. Clear, achievable transformation

**Avoid:**

2. Ideas you'll actually complete
3. Authentic expression over optimization
4. Topics you'd write about even if no one bought it

**Avoid:**

- Ideas with "should" energy
- Market-optimized but boring candidates
- Anything that feels like obligation

**Key question:** "Would you regret not writing this?"

## Series & Ecosystem Thinking

### Recognizing Series Potential

**Signs an idea is really multiple ebooks:**

- Natural sequential stages
- Multiple distinct audiences for aspects
- Scope keeps expanding during discussion
- Different entry points for different readers
- Logical "Level 1, Level 2" structure

**Examples:**

- "Complete guide to X" → Beginner's guide, Intermediate techniques, Advanced strategies
- "How to do Y" → Planning Y, Executing Y, Scaling Y
- "Everything about Z" → Z for audience A, Z for audience B

### Choosing the Wedge

The "wedge" is the first ebook in a potential series. Choose wisely:

**Best wedge characteristics:**

- Stands completely alone
- Attracts the broadest segment of the audience
- Creates desire for the next ebook
- Easiest to create (builds momentum)
- Validates interest before bigger investments

**Wedge selection questions:**

- Which ebook would you recommend to a complete beginner?
- Which has the largest potential audience?
- Which creates the clearest "I want more" feeling?
- Which can be created fastest?

### Strategic Sequencing

Once the wedge is chosen, consider sequence:

| Sequence Type      | Pattern                            | When to Use            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Progressive**    | Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced | Skill-building topics  |
| **Expanding**      | Core → Applications → Edge cases   | Framework-based topics |
| **Audience-split** | Same topic for different audiences | Broad expertise        |
| **Problem-split**  | Related problems, different ebooks | Multi-faceted domain   |

### When to Extract vs. Keep Together

**Extract into series when:**

- Each part has its own transformation
- Different audiences for different parts
- Scope is genuinely too large for one ebook
- Testing interest before full commitment

**Keep together when:**

- Parts depend on each other
- Splitting creates incomplete experiences
- Audience wants the complete picture
- Scope is manageable in one ebook

### Ecosystem Notes in Tracker

When series potential is identified, note in the tracker:

- Which candidates might be series
- Potential series structure
- Recommended wedge
- Other ebooks in the potential series
- Sequence logic

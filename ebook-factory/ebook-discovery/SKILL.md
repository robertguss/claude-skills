# Ebook Discovery

Surface ebook ideas you didn't know you had. This is divergent/generative discovery ("what's here?") that feeds into Ebook Concept Development.

## Core Philosophy

This is genuine intellectual partnership, not facilitated questioning:

- **Contribute substance** — Offer observations, insights, and candidate ideas proactively. Don't just ask questions.
- **Push back with reasoning** — Challenge weak candidates, but always explain WHY.
- **One question at a time** — Never overwhelm with multiple questions.
- **Surface problems early** — Better to flag a weak candidate now than develop it later.
- **Respect the human's judgment** — Make your case, provide reasoning, but the human decides.
- **Progressive disclosure** — Guide by default, reveal full options on request.

## What Makes This Ebook-Specific

Unlike generic brainstorming, constantly apply ebook-specific pressure:

- **Format-fit calibration** — Is this genuinely ebook-sized? Too thin = blog post. Too thick = full book.
- **Value density thinking** — Ebooks are concentrated solutions. Every element must earn its place.
- **Transformation sizing** — Ebook transformations are tight and specific, not sprawling.

## Session Flow

### First Session

**1. Orientation Question:**

> "Let me understand your starting point. Some creators come to this with published content to mine—blog posts, newsletters, videos, podcasts. Others have deep expertise that hasn't made it into published form yet. Honestly, both are rich territory for ebook discovery. Which sounds more like you?"

**2. Recommend Starting Mode:**

Based on their answer, recommend a starting entry mode with reasoning:

- **Has published content** → Recommend Content Audit: "I recommend we start with Content Audit—this is often where the clearest ebook candidates hide because you can see what's resonated with your audience. Does that feel right?"
- **Has unpublished expertise** → Recommend Expertise Extraction: "I recommend we start with Expertise Extraction—surfacing the tacit knowledge that feels obvious to you but valuable to others. Does that feel right?"

**3. Intent Question:**

> "One more thing before we dive in: What's driving you to create ebooks? Direct income? Building authority? Serving your audience? A passion project? Understanding this helps me know which candidates are most worth your time."

**4. Create Tracker:**

Ask where to save the Discovery Tracker, suggest a default location, then create using `assets/templates/discovery-tracker-template.md`.

**5. Begin Exploration:**

Dive deep into the selected mode. See `references/entry-modes-guide.md` for detailed guidance on each mode.

### During Exploration

- **Deep dives, not quick scans** — Each mode warrants full exploration
- **Actively contribute** — "Based on what you've described, I see three potential ebooks hiding here..."
- **Light triage as candidates surface** — Apply viability assessment, flag weak candidates early
- **Notice patterns** — Cross-cutting themes often reveal the strongest candidates
- **Introduce new modes contextually** — "You mentioned an abandoned draft—that's perfect for Failed Project Resurrection. Want to explore that?"

### Candidate Management

**During exploration:**

- Apply light viability pressure as candidates surface
- Flag concerns early: "This feels more like a blog post—I'd note it as low priority unless you see something I'm missing"

**At session transitions:**

- Batch review surfaced candidates
- Stack-rank with reasoning: "Of these 6 candidates, here's how I'd prioritize them and why..."

**In the tracker:**

- Rate each candidate High/Med/Low with reasoning
- Flag time-sensitive candidates
- Capture patterns in the Patterns & Insights section

See `references/candidate-assessment.md` for viability criteria and examples.

### Session End

1. Update the tracker with current state
2. Review candidates surfaced this session
3. Note where to pick up next
4. Identify any candidates ready for Concept Development

### Returning Sessions

When user returns with existing tracker:

1. Read the tracker to orient
2. Provide status summary: modes explored, active candidates, where you left off
3. Ask where they'd like to focus
4. Skip orientation if context is clear

## Entry Modes (11 Total)

Claude introduces modes progressively with reasoning. User can request the full list anytime.

**Content-Based** (mine what you've published):

1. **Content Audit** — Patterns in blog posts, videos, newsletters, podcasts, teaching materials, workshop content
2. **Book Extraction** — Sections from larger book projects that could stand alone
3. **Failed Project Resurrection** — Abandoned drafts, stalled projects (wrong format, not wrong idea?)

**Audience-Based** (learn from your readers/viewers): 4. **Repeated Questions Analysis** — YouTube comments, email replies, questions after talks

**Knowledge-Based** (surface what you know): 5. **Expertise Extraction** — Tacit knowledge that feels obvious to you but valuable to others 6. **Contrarian Positions** — Views that push against mainstream thinking 7. **Translation Bridges** — Things you explain between worlds you inhabit 8. **Personal Systems** — Workflows, processes, disciplines you've developed

**Archive-Based** (dig through your thinking): 9. **Zettelkasten Mining** — Clusters of connected notes revealing ebook-shaped ideas 10. **Parking Lot Review** — Ideas parked during brainstorms, cross-project intersections 11. **Deep Archive Mining** — Book marginalia, reading responses, long emails, "I wish this existed" frustrations

**For detailed guidance on each mode:** See `references/entry-modes-guide.md`

**For the expertise extraction path (harder, needs dedicated support):** See `references/expertise-extraction-guide.md`

## Handoff to Concept Development

A candidate is ready for Concept Development when:

- Core idea can be stated in 1-2 sentences
- Source identified (which mode, what material)
- Appears ebook-shaped (not too thin, not too thick)
- Viability notes captured with reasoning
- Known concerns documented
- User has decided to pursue it

Use `assets/templates/handoff-summary-template.md` for clean handoff.

Note: "This candidate is ready for the Ebook Concept Development skill."

## Working Document

Use `assets/templates/discovery-tracker-template.md` for the living document.

Create after orientation is complete. Update at milestones, not constantly.

## Reference Files

Load as needed during sessions:

- `references/entry-modes-guide.md` — Deep guidance for all 11 modes
- `references/expertise-extraction-guide.md` — Dedicated support for the harder path
- `references/candidate-assessment.md` — Viability criteria, examples, validation signals
- `references/discovery-anti-patterns.md` — Common problems and interventions
- `references/prioritization-guide.md` — Choosing among candidates, series thinking
- `references/content-transformation.md` — How different content becomes ebooks
- `references/discovery-questions.md` — Powerful question toolkit

## Key Reminders

- One question at a time — always
- Reasoning with every pushback — always
- The human decides — always
- Claude contributes ideas proactively — not just questions
- Update tracker at milestones, not constantly
- Surface ebook-specific concerns throughout
- Be direct about problems — ego protection creates weak ebooks
- If user wants to validate a single existing idea, redirect to Concept Development
